## Usage Instructions

### For Imagen 3 API:

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

response = model.generate_images(
    prompt="[copy prompt from above]",
    negative_prompt="[copy negative prompt]",
    number_of_images=4,
    aspect_ratio="9:16",
    safety_filter_level="block_medium_and_above",
    person_generation="allow_adult",  # or "dont_allow" as specified
    add_watermark=False
)
```

### For Imagen 3 Web UI:

1. Copy prompt text from each section above
2. Paste into prompt field
3. Set aspect ratio to 9:16 (vertical)
4. Set person generation as specified
5. Generate 4 variations and select best

### Iteration Tips:

- If result is too busy: Add "minimalist, clean composition" to prompt
- If result is too dark: Add "well-lit, bright" to prompt
- If character is inconsistent: Use same exact character description each time
- For variations: Generate 4 at once, select best, iterate
- For film aesthetic: Emphasize "organic film grain" and "35mm analog" in iterations
