   - Apply 35mm film aesthetic consistently

2. **Organize outputs:**
   - Name files: `scene-{N}{letter}-{start|end}.png`
   - Example: `scene-1a-start.png`, `scene-1a-end.png`

3. **Proceed to arch-v workflow:**
   - Load: `.bmad/creative-studio/workflows/arch-v/workflow.md`
   - Generate Veo 3 prompts using these keyframe pairs
