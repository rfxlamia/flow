## WORKFLOW QUESTIONS FOR USER

### Q1: Production Path
```
Berdasarkan output Imagine, path yang terdeteksi: IMAGE-TO-VIDEO

Dual keyframe mode aktif - setiap scene memiliki first frame dan last frame.

Veo 3 akan menginterpolasi antara kedua frame untuk menghasilkan video.

Konfirmasi path ini? [Y] Ya / [N] Ubah ke path lain
```

### Q2: Prompt Complexity
```
Untuk setiap scene, pilih kompleksitas prompt:

1. SHORT PROMPT (untuk scene sederhana)
   - Filler shots, B-roll, atmospheric
   - < 3 sentences

2. LONG PROMPT (untuk scene kompleks)
   - Dialogue, character continuity
   - Multi-beat sequences, complex choreography

Default: Otomatis berdasarkan scene type
```

## DUAL KEYFRAME INTEGRATION GUIDE

### How Dual Keyframe Works with Veo 3


**Image-to-Video Interpolation:**

1. **First Frame (from Imagine):** Opening composition
   - Character starting position
   - Initial emotional state
   - Environment at t=0

2. **Last Frame (from Imagine):** Closing composition
   - Character ending position
   - Final emotional state
   - Environment at t=8s

3. **Veo 3 Motion Prompt:**
   - Describe the MOTION between frames
   - Camera movement (if any)
   - Audio/dialogue timing
   - Action pacing

**Prompt Structure for Interpolation:**
```
[Describe motion from first frame to last frame].
Camera: [movement or static].
Audio: [character] says: "[dialogue]" / [ambient sound]
Duration: 8 seconds, smooth interpolation.
Start image: [reference first frame]
End image: [reference last frame]
```
