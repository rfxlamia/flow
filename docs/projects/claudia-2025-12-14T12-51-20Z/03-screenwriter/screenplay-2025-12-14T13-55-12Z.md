Camera slowly pans across an impossibly pristine desk workspace. Everything is bathed in soft, golden hour light that feels slightly artificial.

A MINIMALIST SUCCULENT sits in a trendy ceramic pot—but EXTREME CLOSE-UP reveals tiny dust particles suspended in the light shaft and fingerprint smudges on the fake leaf (someone positioned it recently).

PASTEL STICKY NOTES are arranged with geometric precision. An AESTHETIC MECHANICAL KEYBOARD glows softly with RGB backlighting.

Lo-fi music plays, dreamy and calming.

Through DIRTY FRAMING—a reflection in the keyboard's glossy surface—we catch a glimpse of a RING LIGHT outside the golden zone, bathed in harsh fluorescent overhead light. The machinery behind the magic.

The camera movement is too slow, too deliberate. Everything is too perfect. Almost uncanny.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
The camera pan continues but begins to SLOW DOWN, losing its smooth momentum.

TEXT APPEARS on screen in clean sans-serif: "You've seen this before."

VOICEOVER (deadpan, almost monotone, Gen-Z affect): "You've seen this before."

The perfection now feels OFF. The lighting FLICKERS for just a fraction of a second. The camera becomes slightly UNSTEADY, as if the operator is losing interest in maintaining the illusion.

Lo-fi music continues, but now it feels performative rather than authentic.

The camera ZOOMS OUT RAPIDLY.

AUDIO GLITCH: The lo-fi music STUTTERS harshly—like a speaker being unplugged mid-playback. The same 0.3-second loop REPEATS three times with digital distortion. Brief speaker CRACKLE and STATIC.

Then: SILENCE. Just room ambience.

The reveal: The "perfect" workspace is actually a SMALL GREEN SCREEN positioned in front of a REAL, CHAOTIC workspace. The green screen has visible wrinkles and edges showing.

The succulent and keyboard are PROPS on isolated stands, positioned just for the shot.

BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN: A messy desk scattered with real work materials under harsh OVERHEAD FLUORESCENT LIGHTING. No golden hour here—just cold, utilitarian brightness.

Through DIRTY FRAMING, the zoom is slightly unsteady. We catch the edge of the CAMERA RIG and TRIPOD in the corner of frame.

The illusion is broken. The staging is exposed.

Screen GLITCHES with digital distortion effect. The aesthetic dissolves completely.

HARD CUT to the ACTUAL WORKSPACE:

A LAPTOP covered in random stickers (coding bootcamp, obscure bands, ironic memes). The screen shows a BROWSER WINDOW with 47+ TABS open. Zooming in through DIRTY FRAMING—shot at an angle where the screen reflection shows the CONTENT CREATOR'S tired face—we can read tab titles:

"why do I procrastinate"
"imposter syndrome help"
"is this burnout"
"how to focus better"

MULTIPLE COFFEE CUP RINGS overlap on the desk surface, archaeological layers of different work sessions.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP: A COFFEE MUG with cold, half-finished coffee. A thin film of oil/dust catches harsh overhead light. Dried lipstick stain on rim. This coffee has been sitting for 6+ hours. Shot is HANDHELD, slightly shaky.

A PHONE sits face-up: 47 UNREAD NOTIFICATIONS. Battery: 12%.

TANGLED CHARGING CABLES snake across the desk like technological vines.

UNDER-THE-DESK SHOT (low, dirty angle): A FOOT taps rapidly on floor in irregular, anxious rhythm. Shoes kicked off messily.

NOTIFICATION BOMB: Eight to ten notification sounds LAYER SIMULTANEOUSLY—Slack pings, email swooshes, WhatsApp vibrations—creating a brief sonic anxiety spike.

Then: SILENCE and heavy breathing.

The CONTENT CREATOR (late 20s, hoodie, messy hair) sits in their real workspace, looking at camera with a knowing, exhausted expression.

Background: The audible HUM of laptop fan. The sound of real work, not aesthetic silence.

  <action>
The CONTENT CREATOR looks DIRECTLY at camera. Full fourth-wall break.

CLOSE-UP: Unfiltered. No soft focus. No ring light flattery. Just honest eye contact under harsh overhead fluorescent.

VOICEOVER (same deadpan tone): "Real work isn't aesthetic. It's messy."

They gesture toward their chaotic desk with a SLIGHT SHRUG—not apologetic, just matter-of-fact.

No music. Just the ambient sound of the room: laptop fan, distant traffic, the refrigerator humming in another room.

Their expression says: "We're all in this together. Stop pretending."

  <action>
The CLAUDE INTERFACE appears on the laptop screen, integrated naturally into the chaos.

VISUAL SPLIT: The screen divides vertically.

LEFT SIDE: The messy workspace continues unchanged. Coffee rings. Tangled cables. Scattered papers. Everything stays exactly as messy as before.

RIGHT SIDE: Claude interface appears—clean, minimal, readable. But it's not replacing the mess. It's coexisting with it.

The CONTENT CREATOR starts typing. We see their FINGERS on keyboard, real and unperformed:

"help me think through this disaster"

A real question. Not polished. Not rehearsed. Just honest.

The chaos doesn't disappear. The tool integrates into reality.

VOICEOVER: "What if your AI didn't pretend to fix you..."

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
QUICK CUTS (2-3 seconds each) showing real interaction:

CUT: CLAUDE RESPONSE appears on screen with thoughtful suggestions. Actual readable text, genuine advice, not marketing copy.

CUT: CONTENT CREATOR reading, NODDING slightly. Furrowed brow. Processing.

CUT: OVERHEAD SHOT—Hands SCRIBBLING on paper. NOT neat notes. Aggressive scratching: arrows connecting ideas, big X marks through wrong thoughts, question marks everywhere. Then CRUMPLING that paper and starting fresh on a new sheet.

HANDHELD camera moves with the hand movements. Feels urgent. DIRTY FRAMING: shot includes edge of coffee mug, keyboard corner, creating claustrophobic "inside the brain" feel.

CUT: WIDE ANGLE from room corner (CCTV/security cam aesthetic, slightly fish-eye): Person STANDS UP from desk, walks four steps while reading Claude response on phone, TURNS AROUND, paces back. Clearly in "the zone," unconscious of being filmed. They GESTURE with one hand while reading.

Real thinking happens with the body, not just sitting pretty.

CUT: EXTREME CLOSE-UP on EYE/PUPIL, shot from side angle (voyeuristic). Pupil moves RAPIDLY left-right-left reading screen text. Brief moment where eye STOPS (processing), then continues. Micro-expressions: slight squint, eyebrow raise. Backlight from screen creates edge lighting on iris.

Thinking made visible.

CUT: Going back to Claude, asking FOLLOW-UP question. Real typing with typos being corrected in real-time.

CUT: Ideas starting to ORGANIZE. Mind map on paper gaining new branches. Second monitor showing research tab opening.

NOT polished output—raw work-in-progress.

AUDIO LAYER: Keyboard typing (irregular rhythm—thinking pauses, then bursts). Pen scratching on paper (aggressive). Paper crumpling. Quiet "hmm" from person. Mouse clicking. Breathing patterns changing—shallow when stuck, deeper when idea clicks.

NO MUSIC. Just raw work sounds creating rhythmic texture.

The workspace remains messy throughout. But progress is visible through the organizing thoughts, not through aesthetic transformation.

The SPLIT SCREEN COLLAPSES back to single view.

The CONTENT CREATOR continues working with Claude interface visible on their screen. They're in the same messy workspace—nothing has magically cleaned up—but they're actively engaged in productive thinking.

Camera PULLS BACK SLIGHTLY to show full scene: imperfect but functional.

They reach for their COFFEE CUP (the same cold one from earlier), take a sip without thinking, set it back down on top of another ring stain. Comfortable posture. Not performing. Just working.

The workspace is still messy. Papers scattered. Cables tangled. But it's no longer OVERWHELMING. It's workable chaos.

The mess remains. But it becomes workable.

Resolution without transformation.

Camera holds on FULL SCENE: person working naturally in their real space with Claude visible on screen.

WIDE SHOT showing the whole workspace ecosystem. The mess. The tools. The human. All coexisting.

VOICEOVER (same deadpan tone, final statement): "No productivity porn. Just thinking that works."

CLAUDE BY ANTHROPIC LOGO fades in over the scene—clean, simple, unobtrusive.

TAGLINE TEXT appears on screen: "No productivity porn. Just thinking that works."

The aesthetic lo-fi music does NOT return. Instead: realistic ambient sound. Typing. Occasional sip of coffee. The honest sounds of real work.

The CONTENT CREATOR doesn't look at camera. They're absorbed in their work now. The performance is over. This is real.

FADE OUT on the messy workspace. Still imperfect. Still chaotic. Still working.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Platform Requirements
- **Format:** Vertical 9:16 for Instagram Reels
- **Duration:** 75 seconds total
- **Captions:** Required (auto-generate with emphasis on voiceover text)
- **First 3 seconds:** Critical for scroll-stopping (aesthetic setup + "You've seen this before")

### Visual Strategy
- **Scenes 1-2:** Soft focus, warm tones, perfect framing (aesthetic)
- **Scenes 3-9:** Natural lighting, handheld feel, honest framing (reality)
- **Color Palette Shift:** Warm/pastel → Natural/cooler tones at Scene 3 transition
- **Dirty Framing:** Aggressive use in reality scenes to create voyeuristic intimacy

### Audio Strategy
- **Scenes 1-2:** Lo-fi aesthetic music (dreamy, calming)
- **Scene 3:** Audio glitch/stutter during reveal (sonic breaking point)
- **Scene 4:** Notification bomb + silence
- **Scenes 5-9:** Ambient room sound only (anti-aesthetic)

### Key Props
- Fake succulent plant in ceramic pot
- Aesthetic mechanical keyboard with RGB
- Pastel sticky notes
- Green screen (small, wrinkled)
- Ring light
- Laptop with stickers
- Coffee mug (cold, half-finished)
- Phone (47 notifications, 12% battery)
- Tangled charging cables
- Paper and pen (for handwritten notes)

### Emotional Arc
**Setup (1-3):** Recognition → Suspicion → Vindication
**Development (4-5):** Cathartic relief → Solidarity
**Resolution (6-9):** Hope → Progress → Grounded satisfaction → Empowered acceptance
