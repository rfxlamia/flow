# Validated Screenplay: THE GLITCH IN YOUR PRODUCTIVITY PORN

## Validation Summary

- **Project:** Claudia (claudia-2025-12-14T12-51-20Z)
- **Total Scenes:** 9
- **Total Chunks:** 13
- **Validation Status:** PASSED_WITH_NOTES
- **Risk Assessment:** 4 LOW, 2 MEDIUM, 2 HIGH, 2 CRITICAL (mitigated via chunking)
- **Generated:** 2025-12-14T22:40:30Z

## Production Notes

### Critical Risk Mitigations Applied:
- **Scene 4 (10s):** Split into 2 chunks - separates notification chaos from character reveal
- **Scene 7 (15s):** Split into 2 chunks - separates quick cuts into manageable segments
- **Split screen effects (Scene 6, 8):** Generate as single shots, composite in post-production
- **Text overlays:** All text added in post-production, not generated by Veo 3
- **Audio glitch (Scene 3):** Post-production audio effect

### Post-Production Requirements:
- Text overlays for Scenes 2, 9
- Split screen compositing for Scenes 6, 8
- Audio glitch/stutter effect for Scene 3
- Notification sound layering for Scene 4
- Logo fade-in for Scene 9

## Key Frames for Image Generation

| Chunk ID | Frame Description | Use For |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| 1a | Pristine desk with succulent, keyboard, golden hour | Aesthetic setup / thumbnail option |
| 3a | Green screen reveal showing staged vs real | The "aha" moment |
| 4b | Content creator's tired face, direct eye contact | Character introduction |
| 5a | Unfiltered close-up, fourth wall break | Solidarity moment |
| 6a | Hands typing on laptop with Claude visible | Product integration |
| 7a | Hands scribbling messy notes with cross-outs | Real thinking process |
| 9a | Wide shot of full messy workspace ecosystem | Closing image / thumbnail option |

## Visual Style Guide

### Aesthetic Zone (Scenes 1-2)
- **Color Palette:** Warm golden hour, soft pastels, RGB accents
- **Lighting:** Artificial golden hour, soft and flattering
- **Texture:** Clean, pristine, dust-free surfaces
- **Mood:** Uncanny perfection, slightly unsettling

### Reality Zone (Scenes 3-9)
- **Color Palette:** Cool fluorescent whites, natural tones, no color grading
- **Lighting:** Harsh overhead fluorescent, unflattering but honest
- **Texture:** Coffee rings, fingerprints, tangled cables, worn surfaces
- **Mood:** Authentic, relatable, liberating imperfection

### Transition (Scene 3)
- **Visual:** Rapid zoom out reveal
- **Audio:** Glitch/stutter breaking the aesthetic
- **Color:** Warm zone shrinks, cold reality expands

### Character Consistency
- Late 20s, casual hoodie, messy uncombed hair
- Tired but knowing expression
- Natural, unperformed movements
- Same person throughout all scenes

## Audio Design Summary

| Scenes | Audio Type | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1-2 | Lo-fi aesthetic music | Dreamy, calming, performative |
| 3 | Glitch + silence | Music stutters 3x, crackle, silence |
| 4 | Notification bomb + silence | 8-10 sounds layered, then quiet |
| 5-9 | Ambient only | Laptop fan, typing, room sounds, NO music |
