## Visual Style Guide

**Color Temperature Progression:**
- Babak I: Cool/harsh grays → brief warmth at hand contact
- Babak II: Warm golden, amber, soft focus
- Babak III: Desaturating, storm grays, muted
- Babak IV: Colorless gray, monochrome

**Texture Focus:**
- Peeling paint, salt-worn timber
- Fraying rope fibers (progression)
- Worn fabric, faded shirts
- Crumpled sheets, empty spaces

**Water Motif:**
- Aggressive waves → Calm sea → Leak ignored → Dead calm → Coffee to ocean

---

## Character Consistency Reference

**PELAUT:**
- Late 20s-30s, male
- Weather-worn face, calloused hands dark with oil and salt
- Key: Calloused hands (critical for inserts)
- Arc: Closed-off → Opening → Consumed by guilt

**PENDATANG:**
- Late 20s-30s, male
- Softer features, less weathered, searching eyes
- Key: Physical transformation (thinning), neck scar from Scene 4
- Arc: Seeking → Found → Fading

---

## Editing Notes

**Continuity Tags:**
- All chunks tagged with `continues_from` for seamless editing
- 86% static camera for maximum Veo 3 consistency
- One camera movement per chunk maximum

**Insert Placement:**
- Pre-scene: INSERT 01, 11, 16 (set atmosphere)
- Mid-scene: INSERT 07, 12, 20 (breathing room)
- Post-scene: INSERT 06, 21 (lingering resonance)

**Audio Continuity:**
- Ambient sounds carry across chunks
- Dialogue minimal (4 exchanges total)
- Music to be added in post-production
