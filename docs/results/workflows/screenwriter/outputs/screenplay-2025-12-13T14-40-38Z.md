Golden hour light catches the decay. A small sailing vessel rocks gently at the old wooden dock.

PELAUT (late 20s-30s, male, weather-worn face, calloused hands dark with oil and salt) moves across deck with mechanical efficiency. Every movement practiced, solitary. He checks lines, secures cargo, adjusts rigging.

The boat is clearly configured for one: single hammock visible through cabin opening, one tin cup, one dented plate.

PELAUT doesn't fix the tangled ropes. He simply steps over the chaos, focused only on what keeps the boat moving.

The sails flutter unexpectedly, catching air they shouldn't. PELAUT looks up, surprised. His routine interrupted.

At the far end of the dock: a silhouette.

PENDATANG (late 20s-30s, male, softer features, less weathered than Pelaut) stands backlit by the sinking sun. His posture says: nowhere left to go.

He walks forward. Footsteps on old wood. Each step closer feels inevitable.

PELAUT watches, hand still on the rigging. Annoyance... then something else. Curiosity he hasn't felt in years.

PENDATANG stands at the edge. The gap between dock and boat—small, but it's everything.

He hesitates.

PELAUT unties the mooring rope. It falls from the post, splashes into water.

The boat begins to drift away. The dock recedes.

Choice made.

**PART A: THE FOREIGN MARKET (8-10s)**

A busy coastal market. Foreign faces, unfamiliar language shouted over fish and fabric. Chaotic energy—bodies pressing, vendors calling.

PELAUT and PENDATANG move through the crowd. They don't speak. PELAUT gestures toward a fish vendor. PENDATANG nods, counts coins from his pocket.

The world around them is noise. Between them: clarity. A solid unit in foreign chaos.

**PART B: SHARED BURDEN (10-12s)**

They carry heavy cargo together—nets, wooden barrels, supplies. PELAUT lifts one end. PENDATANG mirrors, takes the other.

The weight forces them close. Shoulders bump as they navigate from dock to deck. Footsteps sync—left, right, left.

A sharp edge catches PENDATANG's neck—he flinches, but doesn't drop his end. Small cut, beading blood. He wipes it quickly, keeps moving.

PELAUT adjusts his grip. PENDATANG mirrors immediately. Technical efficiency that looks like choreography.

**PART C: TECHNICAL CORRECTION (8-10s)**

Boat deck. PELAUT gestures: secure the cargo properly.

PENDATANG ties a knot. It's wrong—loose, will slip under pressure.

PELAUT's hand moves over PENDATANG's hand. Guides it through the motion again. Fingers correcting fingers.

PELAUT
Seperti ini. (Like this.)

The touch is instructional. But it lingers—half a second too long.

PENDATANG looks up. PELAUT looks away quickly, focuses back on the rope. Clears his throat.

**PART D: THE TOBACCO RITUAL (5-8s)**

Work done. They sit on the deck edge, legs dangling over water. Gentle rocking.

PELAUT rolls tobacco—precise, practiced movements. His hands know this ritual. He finishes, offers it to PENDATANG first.

PENDATANG takes it. Their fingers brush during the exchange.

Smoke rises between them. They sit in quiet. No need to speak. The ocean moves beneath them.

Two trails of smoke rise, drift, merge in the evening sky.

Night. Clear sky scattered with stars.

A single lentera (lantern) on deck creates a small pocket of warm light against the vast darkness.

PENDATANG and PELAUT sit close, wrapped together in one selimut (blanket). Their shoulders touch.

PENDATANG points at stars. PELAUT follows the gesture, looking up... then looks at PENDATANG instead of the sky.

His eyes catch on the small cut on PENDATANG's neck—from earlier, the cargo. He doesn't touch it. Just sees it. Nods slightly, as if cataloging care for later.

Small laughter. Soft, genuine. A sound PELAUT hasn't made in years.

PENDATANG's eyes reflect starlight.

BACKGROUND: Two shirts hang side by side on a line—one faded and salt-worn, one newer and cleaner. Fluttering in the calm sea breeze.

Two lives. Different histories. Intertwining.

BELOW DECK: Water seeps in. Just a little. Pooling quietly in the hull.

PENDATANG climbs down, sees it. He touches the water with his hand—cold, real. He looks up toward the deck where PELAUT works.

Says nothing.

ABOVE: PELAUT calls out—needs help with a rope. Urgent.

PENDATANG climbs back up, leaving the water unaddressed. The leak continues, silent and patient.

Morning. Overcast.

Laut yang luas dan datar tanpa ombak. (Wide, flat sea with no waves.) Dead calm. Not peaceful—hampa. (Empty.)

PELAUT lowers the sails. Slowly. Deliberately. The boat stops moving.

He sits on deck alone, facing the space where PENDATANG used to sit. That space—now just air.

The horizon stretches empty in all directions.

Below deck, water still pools. But it doesn't matter now. Nothing to save.

PENDATANG's shirt still hangs on the line. It moves slightly in the wind. Presence without person.

The sea holds its breath.

Kapal yang berhenti di tengah laut. (A ship stopped in the middle of the ocean.)

The journey was never about the destination.

Morning. Again.

PELAUT makes coffee. Pours two cups. The ritual unchanged.

He picks up the cold cup. Walks to the edge. Pours it overboard. Coffee falls into the ocean, lost.

The empty cup is placed back on deck. Ready for tomorrow's ritual.

The boat moves again. Forward. Alone.

Cangkir kopi yang tidak pernah diminum. (The coffee cup that is never drunk.)

Grief as daily practice. The body remembers even when the mind knows.

Love persists in gestures for no one.

## Production Notes

### Atmospheric Insert Summary

**Total Inserts:** 21
**Total Additional Duration:** ~50-60 seconds
**Categories:**
- Decay/Chaos (Babak I): 5 inserts
- Warmth/Intimacy (Babak II): 5 inserts
- Neglect/Strain (Babak III): 6 inserts
- Emptiness/Ghost (Babak IV): 5 inserts

**Format for Production-Validator:**
- Each insert is a separate `<insert>` XML block
- Contains: type, category, duration, scene_context, description, placement, mood, purpose
- Can be chunked separately from main scenes
- Require individual Imagen 3/4 prompts (atmospheric/detail shots)
- Timing: 2-4 seconds per insert (vs 8-second chunks for main action)

**Masculine Context Revisions (3 inserts):**
1. INSERT 06 (Scene 4): Changed from dust particles to smoke merging - masculine, connects to tobacco ritual
2. INSERT 08 (Scene 5): Changed from fine hair to neck scar from cargo work - masculine care language, continuity
3. INSERT 09 (Scene 5): Changed from large/small shirts to faded/new - history not sizing, more nuanced

### Locations Summary

| Location | INT/EXT | Scenes Used | Inserts | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Dermaga tua (old dock) | EXT | 1, 2, 3 | INSERT 01-05 | Weathered wood, golden hour |
| Open water near dock | EXT | 1B | INSERT 04 | Hostile sea |
| Coastal market | EXT | 4 | - | Brief establishing, chaotic |
| Boat deck | EXT | 1-12 (primary) | INSERT 06-07, 15, 20 | Main location, all weather |
| Boat cabin | INT | 6, 7, 8, 10 | INSERT 13-14, 17-18 | Confined space, glimpses |
| Open ocean | EXT | 1B, 7-9, 11 | INSERT 11, 19 | Vast, isolating, weather shifts |

### Props List (Categorized by Importance)

**CRITICAL (story-essential):**
- Weathered sailing vessel (small, wooden, transforming configuration)
- Two coffee cups (ritual object, Scene 12 central)
- Ropes (deteriorating from Scene 1 → breaking Scene 9)
- Tobacco rolling materials (Scene 4 bonding ritual)

**HIGH (narrative significance):**
- Solo → paired provisions (1 cup→2, 1 hammock→2)
- Compass with visible needle (INSERT 10 metaphor)
- Two shirts: faded/worn vs new (INSERT 09, masculine revision)
- Cargo: nets, barrels, supplies (Scene 4 injury context)

**MEDIUM (atmospheric/detail):**
- Lentera (lantern) for night scenes
- Selimut (shared blanket) Scene 5
- Asbak (ashtray) progressively filling (INSERT 15)
- Crumpled sheets (INSERT 17 absence)
- Water pooling in hull (Scenes 7-9)

### Visual Theme Tracking

**Texture Progression:**
- Babak I: Rough, decayed, harsh (peeling paint, tangled ropes, white knuckles)
- Babak II: Soft, warm, intimate (merged smoke, shared tools, faded fabric)
- Babak III: Fraying, neglected, deteriorating (breaking ropes, flies, fog)
- Babak IV: Ghostly, empty, remnant (crumpled sheets, dissipating steam, still ocean)

**Color Temperature Journey:**
- Scenes 1-3: Cool/harsh grays → brief warmth at hand contact
- Scenes 4-6: Warm golden, amber, soft focus
- Scenes 7-9: Desaturating, storm grays, muted
- Scenes 10-12: Colorless gray, monochrome except steam

**Water Motif Evolution:**
- Scene 1B: Aggressive attacking waves
- Scenes 4-6: Calm supportive sea
- Scenes 7-9: Leak below deck (ignored crisis)
- Scene 11: Dead calm (void)
- Scene 12: Coffee poured into ocean (return to source)

### Dialogue Summary

**Language:** Indonesian (preserved)
**Total lines:** ~5 exchanges across 13 scenes
**Philosophy:** Visual storytelling prioritized, words only for critical moments

**All Dialogue:**
1. Scene 4: "Seperti ini." (Like this.) - Teaching moment
2. Scene 8: "Tidak lapar." (Not hungry.) - Decline begins
3. Scene 9: "Apa kau baik-baik saja?" (Are you okay?) - Too late realization
4. Scene 9: "Hanya lelah." (Just tired.) - Final words

### Masculine Intimacy Approach

**Core Philosophy:** Trust & Guidance over Romantic Attraction

**Physical Touch Justification:**
- Technical correction (knot-tying, Scene 4C)
- Shared burden (cargo carrying, Scene 4B)
- Injury observation without fussing (scar noticing, INSERT 08)
- Ritual sharing (tobacco exchange, Scene 4D)

**Emotional Expression Through:**
- Skill transfer as care language
- Competence as gift
- Silent observation (scar, not mentioned)
- Shared labor creating intimacy
- Parallel existence (smoke merging, shirts together)

**Vulnerability Shown Via:**
- Teaching moments (hand over hand)
- Accepting help (shared cargo weight)
- Quiet rituals (tobacco, coffee)
- Desperate embrace (Scene 9, when defenses break)

### Casting Considerations

**PELAUT:**
- Age: Late 20s-30s
- Physical: Weather-worn, visibly calloused hands (critical for inserts), comfortable with rope work
- Energy: Closed → Opening → Consumed by guilt
- Key skill: Nautical competence, teaching patience

**PENDATANG:**
- Age: Late 20s-30s (similar to Pelaut)
- Physical: Softer initially, must show visible thinning progression
- Energy: Seeking → Found → Fading
- Key skill: Learning physical tasks, quiet receptiveness
- Special: Neck scar makeup (Scene 4B injury → Scene 5 INSERT 08 continuity)

**Dynamic:** Partnership built through labor, romance disguised as technical necessity, grief expressed through ritual

### Special Production Notes for Inserts

**Chunking Strategy for Production-Validator:**

1. **Main Scenes:** 8-second chunks for Veo 3 video generation
2. **Inserts:** 2-4 second individual shots for Imagen 3/4 still generation
3. **Separate Prompts:** Each insert requires atmospheric/detail-focused prompt (different from action prompts)

**Insert Placement Options:**
- **Pre-scene:** Set atmosphere before action (INSERT 01, 11, 16)
- **Mid-scene:** Breathing room, emotional punctuation (INSERT 07, 12, 20)
- **Post-scene:** Lingering resonance, transition (INSERT 06, 21)

**Technical Requirements:**
- ECU (Extreme Close-Up) inserts: Macro lens capability
- Atmospheric inserts: Slow-motion potential (smoke, steam)
- Ghost/sound inserts: Audio design integration critical
