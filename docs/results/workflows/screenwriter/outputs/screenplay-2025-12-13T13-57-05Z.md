<!-- Scene 1 -->

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
Golden hour light catches the decay. A small sailing vessel rocks gently at the old wooden dock—cat kapal mengelupas (paint peeling in strips), revealing salt-weathered timber beneath.

PELAUT (late 20s-30s, male, weather-worn face, calloused hands dark with oil and salt) moves across deck with mechanical efficiency. Every movement practiced, solitary. He checks lines, secures cargo, adjusts rigging.

ECU: His hands—blackened fingernails, rope burns healed over—grip the wheel with excessive force. Control through tension.

The boat is clearly configured for one: single hammock visible through cabin opening, one tin cup, one dented plate. Tali tambang (ropes) lie tangled and wet on the deck—disorder as the default state.

PELAUT doesn't fix them. He simply steps over the chaos, focused only on what keeps the boat moving.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
Ombak agresif—dark foam, dirty and churning, crashes hard against the hull. Spray hits the deck. The sea here is not romantic. It attacks.

PELAUT doesn't flinch. This violence is weather. This violence is Tuesday.

The sea has made him armor.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
A sudden gust—angin yang salah musim (wind out of season).

The sails flutter unexpectedly, catching air they shouldn't. PELAUT looks up, surprised. His routine interrupted.

At the far end of the dock: a silhouette.

PENDATANG (late 20s-30s, male, softer features, less weathered than Pelaut) stands backlit by the sinking sun. His posture says: nowhere left to go.

He walks forward. Footsteps on old wood. Each step closer feels inevitable.

PELAUT watches, hand still on the rigging. Annoyance... then something else. Curiosity he hasn't felt in years.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
PENDATANG stands at the edge. The gap between dock and boat—small, but it's everything.

He hesitates.

PELAUT, after a long moment, extends his hand.

CU: Two hands meet across the gap. PELAUT's hand—rough, calloused, dark with work. PENDATANG's hand—softer, uncertain. Textures touching.

PENDATANG takes the hand. Steps aboard. His weight shifts from land to sea.

PELAUT unties the mooring rope. It falls from the post, splashes into water.

The boat begins to drift away. The dock recedes.

Choice made.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
**PART A: THE FOREIGN MARKET**

A busy coastal market. Foreign faces, unfamiliar language shouted over fish and fabric. Chaotic energy—bodies pressing, vendors calling.

PELAUT and PENDATANG move through the crowd. They don't speak. PELAUT gestures toward a fish vendor. PENDATANG nods, counts coins from his pocket.

The world around them is noise. Between them: clarity. A solid unit in foreign chaos.

**PART B: SHARED BURDEN**

They carry heavy cargo together—nets, wooden barrels, supplies. PELAUT lifts one end. PENDATANG mirrors, takes the other.

The weight forces them close. Shoulders bump as they navigate from dock to deck. Footsteps sync—left, right, left. PELAUT adjusts his grip. PENDATANG mirrors immediately.

Technical efficiency that looks like choreography.

**PART C: TECHNICAL CORRECTION**

Boat deck. PELAUT gestures: secure the cargo properly.

PENDATANG ties a knot. It's wrong—loose, will slip under pressure.

PELAUT's hand moves over PENDATANG's hand. Guides it through the motion again. Fingers correcting fingers.

PELAUT
Seperti ini. (Like this.)

The touch is instructional. But it lingers—half a second too long.

PENDATANG looks up. PELAUT looks away quickly, focuses back on the rope. Clears his throat.

**PART D: THE TOBACCO RITUAL**

Work done. They sit on the deck edge, legs dangling over water. Gentle rocking.

PELAUT rolls tobacco—precise, practiced movements. His hands know this ritual. He finishes, offers it to PENDATANG first.

PENDATANG takes it. Their fingers brush during the exchange.

Smoke rises between them. They sit in quiet. No need to speak. The ocean moves beneath them.

FILLER INSERT: Partikel debu menari-nari di kabin (dust particles dancing in cabin), lit by golden hour sunlight streaming through the small window. The space is softening.

  <action>
Night. Clear sky scattered with stars.

A single lentera (lantern) on deck creates a small pocket of warm light against the vast darkness.

PENDATANG and PELAUT sit close, wrapped together in one selimut (blanket). Their shoulders touch.

PENDATANG points at stars. PELAUT follows the gesture, looking up... then looks at PENDATANG instead of the sky.

Small laughter. Soft, genuine. A sound PELAUT hasn't made in years.

ECU: PENDATANG's eyes reflect starlight. Bulu halus (fine hair) on his cheek catches the lantern glow, golden and soft.

BACKGROUND: Two shirts—one large (PELAUT's), one smaller (PENDATANG's)—hang side by side on a line, fluttering in the calm sea breeze.

Two lives. Intertwined.

Morning. Golden light.

MONTAGE—quick cuts of transformation:

CABIN GLIMPSE: Second hammock appears beside the first.

DECK: Second cup set beside the first cup. Two plates. Two forks.

Clothes draped together on the line—no longer "his" and "his," just "ours."

PENDATANG hands PELAUT coffee without being asked. PELAUT accepts, touches PENDATANG's hand briefly in the exchange. A gesture so small, so natural.

ECU: Kompas (compass)—the needle points steady, true north. No wavering. No more wandering.

Tujuan hidup sudah ditemukan. (Life's purpose, found.)

  <action>
Evening. Langit abu-abu—overcast sky. The boundary between sea and sky blurs, indistinct. Horizon disappearing.

ABOVE DECK: PELAUT works on sails, focused and tense. Tali layar (sail rope) strains—its fibers fraying, splitting apart. Seolah akan putus kapan saja. (As if it will break any moment.)

BELOW DECK: Water seeps in. Just a little. Pooling quietly in the hull.

PENDATANG climbs down, sees it. He touches the water with his hand—cold, real. He looks up toward the deck where PELAUT works.

Says nothing.

ABOVE: PELAUT calls out—needs help with a rope. Urgent.

PENDATANG climbs back up, leaving the water unaddressed. The leak continues, silent and patient.

MONTAGE OF DECLINE—days compressed:

INT. CABIN: Plate of food in front of PENDATANG. He pushes it away.

PENDATANG
Tidak lapar. (Not hungry.)

The plate sits. Untouched. Lalat kecil (small flies) land on it. Kehidupan yang tidak dipelihara. (Life not maintained.)

---

PENDATANG sleeps during the day. Curled in hammock while sun is still high.

---

DECK: Storm clouds gathering. PELAUT focused on navigation, trimming sails. Below, PENDATANG's face grows thinner. Cheekbones sharper. Eyes losing their searching quality—just... empty.

---

CABIN WINDOW: Kaca berembun, terkena cipratan hujan (glass fogged, rain-spattered). The view outside blurs. The world narrows.

---

ECU: Asbak penuh puntung rokok (ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts). PELAUT smoking more. Sibuk "menjaga kapal," tidak menjaga orang. (Busy "maintaining the ship," not maintaining the person.)

---

PENDATANG's clothes hang looser. His hands, thinner.

He stares at the horizon. But his eyes—they don't search anymore. They're just... open.

Rain falls. Steady, cold.

ECU: The frayed rope from Scene 7—one fiber snaps. Putus satu serat. (One strand breaks.) Not completely broken. But the point of no return is here.

PELAUT finally stops working. Turns to PENDATANG, really sees him for the first time in days.

PELAUT
Apa kau baik-baik saja?
(Are you okay?)

PENDATANG smiles. The same smile from the dock—courage held together by exhaustion.

PENDATANG
Hanya lelah.
(Just tired.)

PELAUT embraces him tightly. Desperately. As if holding on can stop what's already happening.

Rain continues. Below deck, through gaps in the planks, water pools deeper.

Terlambat. Terlalu terlambat. (Too late. Far too late.)

Subuh. Early dawn. Gray light, weak and colorless.

PELAUT wakes.

The space beside him is still. Too still.

PENDATANG's eyes are closed. His hand is cold.

PELAUT's hand reaches out. Takes the cold hand. Holds it.

No movement. No response.

PELAUT's face crumbles. Silent. No scream. Just... breaking.

ECU: Seprai kusut (crumpled sheets) still holding the shape of PENDATANG's body. But cold.

The door to the cabin—pintu kabin terbuka-tutup sendiri (opens and closes by itself), moved by wind. Creaking. Suara yang sepi. (A lonely sound.)

The space mourns.

Morning. Overcast.

Laut yang luas dan datar tanpa ombak. (Wide, flat sea with no waves.) Dead calm. Not peaceful—hampa. (Empty.)

PELAUT lowers the sails. Slowly. Deliberately. The boat stops moving.

He sits on deck alone, facing the space where PENDATANG used to sit. That space—now just air.

The horizon stretches empty in all directions.

Below deck, water still pools. But it doesn't matter now. Nothing to save.

PENDATANG's shirt still hangs on the line. It moves slightly in the wind. Presence without person.

The sea holds its breath.

Kapal yang berhenti di tengah laut. (A ship stopped in the middle of the ocean.)

The journey was never about the destination.

ECU: Uap panas mengepul dari cangkir kopi (steam rising from coffee cup). It thins... thins... disappears. Nyawa yang pergi. (Life departing.)

PELAUT drinks one cup.

The other sits. Grows cold. Waiting for no one.

He picks up the cold cup. Walks to the edge. Pours it overboard. Coffee falls into the ocean, lost.

The empty cup is placed back on deck. Ready for tomorrow's ritual.

The boat moves again. Forward. Alone.

Cangkir kopi yang tidak pernah diminum. (The coffee cup that is never drunk.)

Grief as daily practice. The body remembers even when the mind knows.

Love persists in gestures for no one.

## Production Notes

### Locations Summary

| Location | INT/EXT | Scenes Used | Notes |

| Boat cabin/interior | INT | 6, 7, 8, 10 | Glimpses only - hammocks, provisions, confined space |
| Open ocean | EXT | 1B, 7, 8, 9, 11 | Vast, isolating, weather changes |

### Props List

**Act I (Pertemuan):**
- Weathered sailing vessel (small, single-person configured initially)
- Peeling paint/rotting wood textures
- Tangled wet ropes
- Solo provisions: 1 tin cup, 1 dented plate, 1 hammock
- Ship's wheel, rigging equipment

**Act II (Perjalanan):**
- Second hammock
- Second cup, second plate, second set of utensils
- Two sets of clothes for drying line (one large, one smaller)
- Lentera (traditional lantern)
- Selimut (blanket) - shared
- Kompas (compass) with visible needle
- Tobacco rolling materials
- Coffee making equipment
- Cargo: nets, wooden barrels, supplies
- Coastal market elements (brief): fish, fabric, foreign currency

**Act III (Pengorbanan):**
- Fraying ropes (visible deterioration)
- Untouched food on plate
- Asbak (ashtray) - increasingly full of cigarette butts
- Water pooling in hull
- Rain/storm effects

**Act IV (Pengakhiran):**
- Crumpled sheets/bedding
- Cold coffee
- PENDATANG's shirt on clothesline (ghost presence)

### Key Visual Themes

**Texture Progression:**
- Act I: Rough, decayed, harsh (peeling paint, tangled ropes, calloused hands)
- Act II: Soft, warm, intimate (dust in golden light, shared fabric, gentle touch)
- Act III: Fraying, neglected, deteriorating (breaking ropes, foggy glass, untouched food)
- Act IV: Ghostly, empty, remnant (crumpled sheets, dissipating steam, still ocean)

**Color Temperature:**
- Scenes 1-3: Cool, harsh blues and grays, brief warmth when hands meet
- Scenes 4-6: Warm golden, amber, soft focus
- Scenes 7-9: Desaturating, storm grays, muted tones
- Scenes 10-12: Colorless gray, monochrome except coffee steam

**Water Motif:**
- Aggressive waves (Scene 1B) → Calm sea for partnership (Scene 4-6) → Leak below deck (Scene 7-9) → Still/dead calm (Scene 11) → Coffee poured into ocean (Scene 12)

### Atmospheric Filler Shots Integration

**Placement Guidelines:**
- Use during scene transitions and emotional pauses
- Never interrupt dialogue mid-flow
- ECU/abstract shots before or after emotional beats
- Serve as breathing room between intense moments

**Filler Categories Used:**
- **Babak I**: Decay, chaos, aggression, tension
- **Babak II**: Golden light, masculine intimacy (shared labor), domestic details
- **Babak III**: Environmental blur, decay/neglect, isolation, strain
- **Babak IV**: Absence, ghostly presence, void, symbolic departure

### Dialogue Notes

- **Language:** Indonesian (preserved from source)
- **Minimal by design:** Visual storytelling prioritized
- **Total dialogue lines:** ~5 short exchanges across 13 scenes
- **Key phrases:**
  - "Seperti ini" (Like this) - Scene 4
  - "Tidak lapar" (Not hungry) - Scene 8
  - "Apa kau baik-baik saja?" (Are you okay?) - Scene 9
  - "Hanya lelah" (Just tired) - Scene 9

### Special Formatting Notes

**Scene 4 (Partnership Montage):**
- Structured in 4 distinct parts (A-D)
- Each part has specific timing (8-10s, 10-12s, 8-10s, 5-8s)
- Focus: Male-male intimacy through trust & guidance
- Physical touch is "technical" but carries emotional weight
- Emphasizes competence as care language

**Masculine Intimacy Approach:**
- Touch justified by instruction/labor
- Emotions expressed through shared burden
- Vulnerability shown through skill-sharing
- Romance "disguised" as partnership

### Casting Considerations

**PELAUT:**
- Age: Late 20s-30s
- Build: Weather-worn, muscular from labor
- Hands: Visibly calloused, scarred, essential to character
- Energy: Closed-off initially → opening → consumed by guilt
- Key skill: Comfortable with nautical work, rope handling

**PENDATANG:**
- Age: Late 20s-30s (similar to Pelaut)
- Build: Softer, less weathered, but capable
- Energy: Seeking → found → fading
- Key skill: Learning physical tasks, quiet presence

**Dynamic:** Trust built through labor, intimacy through teaching, grief through ritual
