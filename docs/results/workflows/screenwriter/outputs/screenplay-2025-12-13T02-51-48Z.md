## Characters

### PELAUT (The Sailor)
**First Appearance:** Scene 1
**Description:** Late 20s-30s. Weather-worn face, calloused hands. Moves with purpose and efficiency. Eyes that have seen many horizons. Begins closed-off and self-sufficient, opens to love, consumed by guilt and grief.

### PENDATANG (The Newcomer)
**First Appearance:** Scene 2
**Description:** Same age range. Softer features, less weathered. Stands like someone who lost their anchor. Eyes that search for home. Seeking, then found, then slowly disappearing.

<!-- Scene 1 -->

    <visual>sails set at precise angles, single hammock visible</visual>
  </key_visuals>
  <action>
A weathered fishing boat rocks gently at the old wooden dock. Paint peels from the hull like dead skin, revealing salt-scarred wood beneath.

PELAUT (late 20s-30s, weather-worn face, calloused hands that have known a thousand ropes) moves efficiently across the deck. He checks lines, secures cargo—every motion the muscle memory of a thousand departures.

The boat is clearly set for one: single hammock strung between mast and cabin wall. One cup. One plate. One life, carefully maintained.

His hands—stained with oil and salt—grip the wheel with white knuckles. More force than necessary. Control through pressure.

INSERT: Cat kapal mengelupas. Tali tambang kusut dan basah tergeletak sembarangan.

Golden hour light catches the rust and rot, making even decay beautiful for a moment.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
Dark foam crashes against the hull. Not the romantic blue of postcards—this is dirty water, aggressive water. The sea attacks.

Spray hits the deck, soaking the wood. Pelaut doesn't flinch. Doesn't wipe his face. This violence is normal to him.

The world is harsh. He has armored against it.
  </action>
</scene>

<!-- Scene 2 -->
<scene number="2" duration="20s">
  <slugline>EXT. DERMAGA TUA - MOMENTS LATER</slugline>

    <visual>Pelaut's expression shifting from annoyance to curiosity</visual>
  </key_visuals>
  <action>
A sudden gust. The sails flutter—surprised by wind that came from nowhere. Wrong season for this direction.

Pelaut looks up.

At the end of the dock, a SILHOUETTE. PENDATANG (same age, softer features, less weathered than Pelaut) stands motionless against the dying sun. Their posture says everything: nowhere left to go.

Pendatang begins to walk. Footsteps on weathered wood. Each step closer.

Pelaut's jaw tightens. Then loosens. Annoyance becomes something else—curiosity, perhaps. Recognition of something familiar.

The wind that didn't ask permission has brought someone.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
Pendatang stands at the dock's edge. The gap between land and boat—a meter of water, a lifetime of decision.

Hesitation. The boat rocks gently, indifferent.

After a long moment, Pelaut extends a hand. Dirty, calloused, scarred.

INSERT: The hands meeting. Pelaut's rough skin against Pendatang's softer palm. Two textures. Two lives.

Pendatang takes it. Steps across. Foot leaves dock, lands on deck.

The rope is untied from the mooring post. Falls into the water with a soft splash.

Behind them, the dock begins to shrink. There is no going back.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
Sunlight warms the deck. The harsh gray of the dock feels far away now.

Pelaut demonstrates how to tie a knot. His fingers move with the ease of ten thousand repetitions.

Pendatang's hands fumble. The rope slips. Try again.

INSERT: Partikel debu menari-nari di kabin, diterangi sinar matahari sore. The space is softening.

Slowly, Pendatang's fingers find the rhythm. The knot forms. Not perfect, but holding.

Pelaut watches. Almost smiles. The first crack in his armor.

On deck, two shadows move together. Learning the same patterns. The boat carries them forward.

  <action>
Night. The deck illuminated only by a single lentera (lantern), its flame dancing in the sea breeze.

Pelaut and Pendatang sit close, wrapped in one selimut (blanket). The space that separated them has dissolved.

Pendatang points upward. Stars. Pelaut follows the gesture, then turns—looks at Pendatang instead of the sky.

INSERT: ECU pada mata Pendatang. Starlight reflected. Bulu halus di pipi terkena cahaya lentera.

Small laughter. Soft and genuine—the sound of two people discovering each other.

Behind them, two shirts hang on a rope, drying side by side. Berkibar ditiup angin laut. Two lives intertwined.

This is what home feels like when home can move.

MONTAGE:

A second hammock appears, strung beside the first.

A second cup set beside the original.

Clothes draped together on the same line.

Two plates. Two forks. The arithmetic of love.

INSERT: ECU pada kompas. The needle holds steady, pointing true. No wavering. Tujuan hidup sudah ditemukan.

Pendatang hands Pelaut coffee without being asked. Pelaut accepts. Their fingers touch briefly on the cup.

The solo voyage has become a partnership. Direction has been found.

  </key_visuals>
  <action>
The sky has turned gray. Where ocean ends and sky begins—impossible to tell anymore. The horizon has disappeared.

Pelaut works on the sails, focused. Adjusting. Always adjusting.

Below deck: water. Just a little. Seeping in through somewhere unseen.

Pendatang notices. Kneels. Touches the water. Cold.

INSERT: Langit abu-abu. Batas antara laut dan langit kabur.

Above, Pelaut calls out—needs help with a rope.

Pendatang climbs up. Says nothing about the water. Leaves it pooling in the dark.

INSERT: Tali layar yang mulai frayed. Seratnya putus-putus. Menegang. Almost breaking.

MONTAGE OF DECLINE:

Pendatang pushes food away.

INSERT: Makanan di piring yang tidak disentuh. Lalat kecil hinggap.

Pendatang sleeps during the day. And the next day. And the next.

Pelaut sees but doesn't see. Storm clouds are gathering on the horizon. The boat needs attention.

INSERT: Kaca jendela kabin berembun. Cipratan hujan. The world outside blurs.

INSERT: Asbak rokok penuh puntung. Pelaut smokes more now. Busy keeping the boat afloat. Not busy enough for the person on it.

Pendatang's face grows thinner. Clothes hang where they once fit.

Those eyes—the ones that searched for home—now stare at the horizon with nothing behind them.

The water below continues to rise.

Rain. Finally, rain.

INSERT: A single fiber of the fraying rope snaps. Not the whole rope—just one strand. But the first.

Pelaut finally stops working. Turns to Pendatang.

Rain streams down both their faces. Or tears. Impossible to tell which.

Pendatang smiles. The same smile from the dock—exhausted courage pretending to be peace.

Pelaut embraces Pendatang. Tight. Too tight. The embrace of someone who just realized what they're about to lose.

Below deck, visible through gaps in the wood, water continues to pool.

It is too late. It was always going to be too late.

Gray light. The colorless hour between night and day.

Pelaut wakes. Reaches across.

The space beside is still.

INSERT: Sisi tempat tidur yang kosong. Seprai masih kusut—bekas tubuh. But cold now. The shape of absence.

Pendatang's eyes are closed. Peaceful. Too peaceful.

Pelaut's hand reaches out. Takes Pendatang's hand. Holds it.

Cold.

No movement. No response.

INSERT: Pintu kabin terbuka-tutup sendiri. Creaking. The space responding to what has happened.

Pelaut's face crumbles. No scream. No sound. Just the silent collapse of everything.

Tears fall without making a sound.

Kau pergi saat aku tertidur.

The ocean stretches in every direction. Flat. No waves. Dead calm.

INSERT: Laut yang luas dan datar. Bukan damai—hampa. Emptiness, not peace.

Pelaut lowers the sails. The fabric falls slowly, reluctantly.

The boat stops moving. For the first time since leaving the dock, stillness.

Pelaut sits on deck. Facing the empty space where Pendatang used to sit.

Behind, Pendatang's shirt still hangs on the line. Moving slightly in what little wind remains. Presence without person.

Below deck, water still pools. But it doesn't matter now. Nothing to save. No one to save it for.

The journey was never about the destination.

Morning. Another morning. Perhaps every morning from now on.

Pelaut makes coffee. The ritual unchanged.

Pours into one cup. Drinks.

Pours into a second cup.

INSERT: ECU pada uap panas mengepul. Uapnya menipis... menipis... hilang. The warmth that cannot stay.

The second cup sits untouched. Grows cold.

Pelaut picks it up. Walks to the edge.

Pours it overboard. Coffee and salt water meeting.

Returns the empty cup to its place. Ready for tomorrow's ritual.

The boat begins to move again. Forward. Alone.

The body remembers what the mind cannot accept.

The cup will wait. It will always wait.
