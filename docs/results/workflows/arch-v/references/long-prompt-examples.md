## Example 1: Romantic Rain Scene

### Format & Tone
Cinematic mini-scene - emotional realism with soft romantic rhythm and atmospheric intimacy. Tone: nostalgic, tender, immersive.

### Main Subject(s)
A young couple standing close under one umbrella in the rain - their chemistry quiet but electric, eyes locked, hesitant smiles.

### Wardrobe and Props
She wears beige trench coat, pearl earrings, carries transparent umbrella; he wears navy jacket, white shirt, wristwatch reflecting streetlight. Props: umbrella, takeaway coffee cup gently steaming.

### Location & Framing
Rain-soaked cobblestone street at dusk outside softly glowing café.

Foreground: falling raindrops and bokeh reflections.  
Midground: the couple framed beneath the umbrella.  
Background: café sign glowing amber, blurred city silhouettes.

Camera alternates between gentle dolly-ins, over-shoulder close-ups, and slow ¾ circular arcs to preserve emotional depth.

### Lighting & Palette
Warm café light spilling onto cool blue-gray rain.

Light sources: diffused streetlight key from camera left, amber window backlight.

Color anchors: blush pink, amber gold, navy blue, cool gray, ivory skin tones.

Soft diffusion lens and wet reflections maintain continuity.

### Continuity Rules
Consistent light rain throughout, dusk lighting (blue hour), café window glow always visible in background, wardrobe unchanged.

### Actions & Camera Beats (0-12s)
0-4s - Wide shot: camera slowly pushes in through rain toward couple; she adjusts umbrella, faint smile.

4-8s - Medium shot: he reaches for her hand; droplets cascade down joined fingers; camera drifts laterally, catching reflection of neon light across faces.

8-12s - Close-up: their foreheads gently meet; camera rises slightly, focusing on breath mixing in rain-haze before fading into soft blur.

### Montage Plan
Three inserts: (raindrop hitting umbrella → fingertip touch → smile). Smooth match cuts guided by piano rhythm; final 0.5-second emotional hold before fade-out. Transitions use natural lens flares from passing car headlights.

### Dialogue
Whisper (female): "Stay a little longer."

He exhales softly, smiling. (no subtitles)

### Sound & Foley
Soft rainfall, muffled footsteps on wet cobblestone, umbrella fabric tension, faint breath, distant café hum, soft piano underscore with subtle reverb.

### Finish
Light film grain, warm halation on highlights, gentle chromatic bloom around neon reflections.

LUT intent: vintage romance with balanced teal-amber contrast.

Poster frame: their hands clasped beneath umbrella, neon reflections rippling across puddled ground like living light.

### Main Subject(s)
Young woman, late 20s, wearing jeans and oversized sweater, flashlight in hand. Alone, increasingly fearful but trying to maintain composure.

### Wardrobe and Props
Dark jeans, gray knit sweater (slightly oversized), practical running shoes, small LED flashlight (her only light source). Props: flashlight creating moving pool of light, dust particles visible in beam.

### Location & Framing
Abandoned Victorian house interior, master bedroom, midnight.

Foreground: Furniture covered in white sheets creating ghost-like shapes.  
Midground: Woman enters cautiously, flashlight sweeping space.  
Background: Darkened doorway leading to black hallway, barely visible wallpaper peeling.

Camera follows from behind, maintaining predatory distance suggesting viewer as threat.

### Lighting & Palette
Extreme low-key lighting, flashlight provides only illumination.

Light sources: Single practical source (her LED flashlight creating harsh, moving shadows), moonlight barely visible through dirty window (minimal blue fill).

Color anchors: Deep blacks dominating frame, cold blue moonlight, warm yellow flashlight beam, desaturated environment, pallid skin tones.

High contrast with crushing blacks, shadows that conceal rather than reveal.

### Continuity Rules
Complete darkness except flashlight and minimal moonlight, time locked at midnight, dust particles always visible in beam, woman's wardrobe unchanged, house sounds consistent (creaks, wind).

### Actions & Camera Beats (0-25s)
0-6s - Wide shot, high angle: Woman enters through doorway; flashlight beam scans room left to right; camera slow crane down suggesting descent into danger.

6-12s - Medium shot, over-shoulder: She advances cautiously toward covered furniture; beam catches sheet draped over tall object; camera dolly in matching her approach.

12-18s - Medium close-up: Her hand reaches toward sheet; hesitates; breathing visible; camera pushes in on face showing fear; flashlight trembles.

18-25s - Close-up: She pulls sheet off suddenly; empty dress form underneath; sharp exhale of relief; camera static; then slow zoom in on doorway behind her as shadow crosses.

### Montage Plan
Four tension-building inserts: (flashlight beam on floor → dust settling → window reflection showing room behind her → door handle slowly turning unseen). Jump cuts on sudden sounds. Final insert: extreme close-up on her eyes widening as she senses presence. Hold 1 second before cut to black.

### Dialogue
She whispers: "Hello? Is someone there?"

[Pause - only house sounds]

She breathes: "This is stupid..." trying to convince herself. (no subtitles)

### Sound & Foley
Floorboards creaking under her weight (each step loud in silence), her breathing (increasingly rapid), flashlight switch clicking, wind through broken window whistling, house settling groans, distant something upstairs (ambiguous - footstep? furniture?), fabric sliding (sheet being removed), her heart beating (subtle low frequency), complete silence before final scare moment.

### Finish
Heavy film grain (16mm quality) creating texture and uncertainty in shadows, no halation (maintaining darkness), crushed blacks hiding details intentionally.

LUT intent: Desaturated horror with emphasis on shadow detail - what's barely visible is more terrifying than what's shown.

Poster frame: Her face illuminated by flashlight from below (classic horror lighting), eyes wide, darkness consuming most of frame, suggestion of shape in background.

## Example 4: Action Chase Sequence

### Format & Tone
High-octane action sequence - adrenaline-driven with visceral energy and kinetic movement. Tone: intense, urgent, chaotic.

### Main Subject(s)
Female operative, 30s, athletic build in tactical gear, running at full sprint. Determined expression, trained movement. Three pursuers in black tactical gear visible behind, armed but non-threatening to viewer focus (background threat).

### Wardrobe and Props
Operative: Dark gray tactical pants, fitted black long-sleeve shirt, tactical vest with pouches, running shoes (practical), ponytail (secured). Pursuers: Matching black tactical gear (establishing them as unit).

Props: Radio earpiece (on operative, wire visible), tactical flashlight (handheld), market goods being knocked over during chase.

### Location & Framing
Middle Eastern bazaar, crowded market, midday harsh sunlight creating strong shadows.

Foreground: Hanging fabrics, market goods, crowd members (civilians creating obstacles).  
Midground: Operative vaulting obstacles, pursuers navigating same path seconds behind.  
Background: Market stalls, colorful awnings, dusty atmosphere, distant minarets establishing location.

Camera aggressive handheld tracking, maintaining pursuit energy, rapid pans showing threats.

### Lighting & Palette
Harsh overhead sun creating deep shadows and high contrast.

Light sources: Direct sunlight from above (noon position), dusty air creating visible light shafts, reflected light from colorful fabrics (red, orange, blue saturation), patches of shadow under awnings.

Color anchors: Saturated reds (fabrics), vivid blues (awnings), golden dust particles, earth tones (walls), operative's dark tactical gear contrasting with colorful environment.

High contrast maintained throughout, sun flares when camera whips past openings.

### Continuity Rules
Midday lighting consistent, dust in air always visible catching light, market crowds constant, wardrobe intact despite action (no damage progression in this 30-second sequence), pursuers maintaining approximate 20-foot distance.

### Actions & Camera Beats (0-30s)
0-6s - Medium tracking shot: Operative runs toward camera then past; camera whip-pans 180 following her; she vaults fruit cart causing scatter; handheld aggressive.

6-12s - Wide shot: She ducks under hanging carpets; camera tracks laterally maintaining speed; pursuers visible behind navigating same obstacles; crowd scatters.

24-30s - Wide establishing: Aerial pullback showing full market; operative small figure weaving through maze of stalls; pursuers converging; end on wide showing complexity of environment.

### Montage Plan
Eight rapid inserts creating pace: (feet hitting ground → fruit scattering → pursuer's radio → operative's eyes → hand grabbing fabric → pottery breaking → crowd reaction → radio chatter). Fast cuts (0.5-1 second each) building intensity. No holds - constant motion. Transitions: jump cuts on action, whip pans between angles.

### Dialogue
Operative breathing: "West exit - thirty seconds." into radio. (no subtitles)

Pursuer's radio (distant): "Cut her off at the fountain!" (no subtitles)

### Sound & Foley
Heavy footfalls (multiple rhythms - her vs. pursuers), labored breathing, fabric tearing, fruit hitting ground and splitting, pottery shattering, crowd shouting (Arabic), radio static and chatter, dust kicking up, market ambience loud, body impacts with obstacles, urgent music building.

No silence - layered chaos throughout emphasizing urgency.

### Finish
Slight motion blur on fastest movements maintaining energy, no film grain (clean digital action aesthetic), increased saturation on market colors creating vibrancy against tactical gear.

LUT intent: High-contrast action grade with saturated environmental colors and protected shadows on faces (maintaining visibility in harsh sun).

Poster frame: Mid-vault over obstacle, frozen in air, dust and market colors surrounding, pursuers visible in background, facial determination visible, dynamic composition.

Inserts 2-3 seconds each, thoughtful pacing matching interview tone. L-cuts with audio (his voice continues over inserts maintaining flow). Final moment: return to face in golden light, slight smile.

### Dialogue
Craftsman: "Each piece of wood tells you what it wants to become. You just have to listen."

[Pause - lets statement breathe]

"I've been listening for fifty years. Still learning." (no subtitles for both - natural speech)

### Sound & Foley
Workshop ambience (distant tools, other craftspeople), his voice (naturally aged, thoughtful pacing), hand running over wood (subtle texture), breathing (natural), street sounds distant outside, wind through workshop, chisel demonstration sound, sawdust settling, authentic room tone throughout.

No music - let scene breathe naturally. Silence is contemplative, not empty.

### Finish
Light 16mm film grain suggesting documentary authenticity, natural color grade preserving warmth of wood and golden hour, minimal contrast adjustment maintaining realism.

LUT intent: Documentary natural with slight warm push emphasizing golden hour and wood tones - honoring truth of moment.

Poster frame: Craftsman's profile in golden window light, hands visible holding chisel, slight smile, workshop visible behind, dust particles in light shaft - capturing lifetime of craft.

## Analysis: What Makes These Work

### Common Success Patterns

**1. Color Anchor Consistency**
All examples use 3-5 specific colors repeated throughout. Notice how:
- Romantic rain: "blush pink, amber gold, navy blue" appear in multiple blocks
- Tech launch: "pure white, matte black, electric blue" define every beat
- Horror: "deep blacks, cold blue, warm yellow" create atmosphere
- Action: "saturated reds, vivid blues, golden dust" energize chase
- Documentary: "warm wood tones, faded blue, golden sun" ground reality

**2. One Camera Movement Per Beat**
Every Action & Camera Beat follows the rule:
- Never: "Dolly in while panning left"
- Always: "Dolly in" (choose one movement, execute it well)

**3. FG/MG/BG Spatial Structure**
Every example explicitly defines three depth layers:
- Prevents floating subjects
- Creates dimensional space
- Guides blocking naturally

**4. Detailed Foley (Not Generic)**
Compare:
- ❌ Generic: "Rain sounds, people talking"
- ✅ Specific: "Soft rainfall, muffled footsteps, umbrella fabric tension, faint breath"

Each example has 6-10 specific sound elements creating immersion.

**5. Explicit Continuity Rules**
Multi-shot examples lock critical elements:
- Time of day specific
- Weather conditions precise
- Wardrobe colors exact
- Lighting quality defined

### Genre-Specific Observations

**Romance (Example 1):**
- Soft movements (gentle dolly, slow arc)
- Warm/cool color contrast (amber vs blue)
- Intimate audio (breathing, whispers)
- Diffusion and glow in finish

**Commercial (Example 2):**
- Controlled precision (exact lighting ratios)
- Clean movements (smooth dolly, precise rotation)
- Minimal audio (product focus)
- Zero grain (pristine digital)

**Horror (Example 3):**
- High contrast (crushing blacks)
- Slow, predatory camera (crane, push in)
- Silence with punctuated sounds
- Heavy grain (texture creates unease)

**Action (Example 4):**
- Handheld aggressive tracking
- Saturated colors (energy)
- Layered chaotic audio
- Fast cuts (0.5-1 second)

**Documentary (Example 5):**
- Natural light (window key)
- Handheld subtle drift (authentic)
- Room tone throughout
- Light grain (16mm feel)

### Adaptation Strategies

**To create your own from these examples:**

1. **Choose genre template** closest to your vision
2. **Swap subjects** (people, products, environments)
3. **Keep structure** (11 blocks, spatial definition)
4. **Maintain color anchor count** (3-5 specific colors)
5. **Use camera vocabulary** from standardized list
6. **Detail foley** (6-10 specific sounds minimum)
7. **Validate** against 8 core components

**Mix genres for unique results:**
- "Documentary realism + Romantic soft lighting"
- "Action energy + Commercial precision"
- "Horror tension + Artistic slow movements"

**Progressive complexity:**
- Start with Example 1 structure (all 11 blocks, moderate detail)
- Simplify to Example 5 (lighter montage, more natural)
- Complexify to Example 2 (extreme precision, technical detail)

### Cross-Reference Integration

All examples integrate with other skills:

**Camera Movements:** All beats use standardized vocabulary (dolly, crane, arc, etc.)  
**Great Prompt Anatomy:** All include 8 mandatory components  
**Continuity:** Color anchors from Lighting block repeated in Continuity block  
**Validation:** Each would pass completeness checklist

## Final Note on Usage

These examples are **complete production briefs** ready for Veo 3. Your prompts should be similarly comprehensive when using long-prompt method.

**Don't mix approaches:**
- Short prompts (1-3 sentences) → Use short-prompt-guide
- Long prompts (all blocks) → Use these examples as models

**Minimum blocks for success:**
Even if skipping optional blocks, always include:
1. Format & Tone
2. Main Subjects
4. Location & Framing (with FG/MG/BG)
7. Actions & Camera Beats (with ONE movement per beat)

**When in doubt:**
Reference the specific example genre closest to your vision and adapt systematically.
