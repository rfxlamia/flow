- **Emotional Core:** Grief intertwined with guilt; love that failed to save
- **Tone:** Poetic-melancholic nautical
- **Target Duration:** 4 minutes

## Character(s)

### PELAUT (The Sailor) — Narrator
**Visual Description:** Late 20s-30s. Weather-worn face, calloused hands. Moves with purpose and efficiency. Eyes that have seen many horizons.
**Emotional State:** Begins closed-off and self-sufficient → opens to love → consumed by guilt and grief
**Key Behaviors:** Checking ropes, adjusting sails, looking at horizon. Later: making two coffees, touching empty spaces.

### PENDATANG (The Newcomer) — Beloved
**Visual Description:** Same age range. Softer features, less weathered. Stands like someone who lost their anchor. Eyes that search for home.
**Emotional State:** Seeking → found → slowly disappearing
**Key Behaviors:** Learning, watching, caring for Pelaut. Later: eating less, sleeping more, staring at horizon with empty eyes.

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

# BABAK I — PERTEMUAN (Kekacauan & Tekstur Kasar)

*Visual Goal: Establish the narrator's damaged soul and harsh environment before love arrives.*

---

### Scene 1: The Prepared Departure

**Location:** Dermaga tua (old wooden dock)
**Time:** Late afternoon, golden hour
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pelaut moves efficiently across deck, checking lines, securing cargo. Everything is methodical—the routine of someone who has done this a thousand times alone. The boat is clearly set for one person: single hammock visible, one cup, one plate.

**[FILLER] Atmospheric Inserts:**
- **ECU: Decay** — Cat kapal mengelupas, kayu lapuk karena garam laut. Fokus pada tekstur kasar—boat has been through too many storms.
- **Abstract: Chaos** — Tali tambang kusut dan basah tergeletak sembarangan di dek. Disorder as default.
- **Sensory: Tension** — Tangan Pelaut yang kotor (oli, garam) mencengkeram kemudi terlalu kuat. Knuckles white. Control through force.

**Key Visuals:**
- Peeling paint revealing weathered wood beneath
- Tangled wet ropes on deck
- Dirty hands gripping wheel too tight
- Solo provisions arranged neatly amid chaos
- Sails set at precise angles

**Emotional Beat:** Solitude as survival—functional but not living

**Story Logic:** "Layar yang sudah kupasang untuk perjalanan sendiri" — solo configuration, but the decay shows this isn't peace—it's endurance

---

### Scene 1B: The Aggressive Sea

**Location:** Open water near dock
**Time:** Same afternoon
**Duration:** ~10 seconds

**[FILLER] Nature Insert:**
- **Ombak Agresif** — Buih ombak yang kotor/gelap menghantam lambung kapal. Bukan ombak cantik—ombak yang menyerang. The sea is not romantic here; it's adversarial.

**Visual Action:**
Dark foam crashes against the hull. Spray hits the deck. Pelaut doesn't flinch—this violence is normal to them.

**Key Visuals:**
- Dirty foam, not crystal blue
- Impact on weathered wood
- Unflinching body language

**Emotional Beat:** The world is harsh, and Pelaut has armored against it

**Story Logic:** Establishes why Pelaut is closed—survival required walls

---

### Scene 2: Wind That Didn't Ask Permission

**Location:** Dermaga tua, same dock
**Time:** Moments later, same golden hour
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

**Visual Action:**
A sudden gust—sails flutter unexpectedly. Pelaut looks up, surprised. At the end of the dock stands Pendatang, silhouetted against the setting sun. Their posture says: nowhere left to go. Pendatang walks toward the boat.

**Key Visuals:**
- Sails catching unexpected wind
- Silhouette at dock's end
- Footsteps on weathered wood
- Pelaut's expression shifting from annoyance to curiosity

**Emotional Beat:** Fate arriving uninvited

**Story Logic:** "Angin yang salah musim" — the wind literally changes as the beloved appears

---

### Scene 3: The Hand Extended

**Location:** Edge of boat at dock
**Time:** Sunset
**Duration:** ~15 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pendatang stands at the edge of the dock. Hesitates. Pelaut, after a long moment, extends a hand. Pendatang takes it. Steps onto the boat. The rope is untied from the dock. The boat begins to drift away.

**[FILLER] Transition Insert:**
- **Contrast Shot** — As hands meet, brief flash: the dirty, calloused hand of Pelaut meets the softer hand of Pendatang. Two textures touching.

**Key Visuals:**
- Two hands meeting across the gap (texture contrast)
- Foot stepping from dock to deck
- Rope falling from mooring post
- Dock receding in background

**Emotional Beat:** The point of no return—choice made

**Story Logic:** "Boleh aku ikut?" made visual through physical crossing of threshold

---

# BABAK II — PERJALANAN (Kehangatan & Detail Intim)

*Visual Goal: Transform the visual language to soft, warm, sensual. Love as domestic worship.*

---

### Scene 4: Partnership Montage (Trust & Guidance)

**Location:** Coastal market → Boat deck, open water
**Time:** Day (sunny, warm light)
**Duration:** ~30-35 seconds

**Visual Action:**

**PART A: The Foreign Market (8-10s)**
Busy coastal market—foreign faces, unfamiliar language, chaotic energy. Pelaut and Pendatang move through the crowd as one unit. Pelaut gestures to fish vendor—Pendatang nods, counts coins. They communicate without words. The world around them is noise; between them is clarity.

**PART B: Shared Burden (10-12s)**
Heavy cargo—nets, barrels, supplies. Pelaut lifts one end, Pendatang takes the other. They carry it together from dock to boat. The weight forces them close. Shoulders bump. Footsteps sync. Pelaut adjusts grip—Pendatang mirrors. Technical efficiency that feels like choreography.

**PART C: Technical Correction (8-10s)**
On deck. Pelaut shows how to secure cargo properly. Pendatang ties a knot—wrong. Pelaut's hand covers Pendatang's hand, guides it through the motion again. "Seperti ini." (Like this.) The touch is instructional, but lingers half a second too long. Pendatang looks up—Pelaut looks away quickly, focuses on the rope.

**PART D: The Tobacco Ritual (5-8s)**
Work done. They sit on deck edge, legs dangling over water. Pelaut rolls tobacco—precise, practiced. Offers it to Pendatang first. Pendatang takes it, their fingers brush. Smoke rises between them. Quiet. No need to speak.

**[FILLER] Atmospheric Insert:**
- **Atmosphere: Smoke Merge** — Asap rokok dari dua sumber menyatu di langit sore, naik bersama ke arah yang sama. Smoke from two sources merging in evening sky, rising together. (Post-tobacco ritual continuity)
- **Masculine Intimacy: Shared Tools** — ECU pada tangan keduanya memegang ujung tali yang sama. Tekanan yang sama. Beban yang dibagi. Trust manifested through labor.

**Key Visuals:**
- Market chaos vs. their synchronized movement
- Two bodies carrying one burden
- Hand over hand (teaching, not caressing)
- Knot tied wrong, then corrected with touch
- Tobacco being rolled with precision
- Fingers brushing during exchange
- Smoke rising, faces relaxed
- Two shadows sitting side by side, legs swinging in rhythm

**Emotional Beat:** Intimacy disguised as partnership—trust built through survival skills, not declarations. In a masculine context (sailors, labor), romance hides in "teaching you to survive."

**Story Logic:** For male-male dynamic, intimacy comes through shared burden and skill transfer. Physical touch is "safe" (technical) but carries weight. The gift is not affection—it's competence, and that's how care is shown.

---

### Scene 5: Night Under Stars

**Location:** Boat deck at night
**Time:** Night, clear sky
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Deck illuminated by single lentera (lantern). Pendatang and Pelaut sit close, wrapped in one selimut (blanket). Pendatang points at stars. Pelaut follows the gesture, then looks at Pendatang instead of the sky. Small laughter, soft and genuine.

**[FILLER] Intimate Inserts:**
- **Body Part: Scar** — ECU bekas luka gores di leher Pendatang (fresh from Scene 4 cargo work). Pelaut mengamati dengan perhatian tenang. Silent masculine care language.
- **Domestic: Clothes** — Dua helai baju dijemur berdampingan: satu pudar/lusuh (Pelaut, bertahun di laut), satu lebih baru/bersih (Pendatang, baru bergabung). History, not sizing. Two lives intertwined.

**Key Visuals:**
- Eyes reflecting starlight (macro)
- Fine hair catching lantern glow
- Two shirts drying side by side
- Lentera creating warm light pocket
- Shared blanket, two bodies close
- Faces illuminated, smiling

**Emotional Beat:** Intimacy blooming—the beginning of home, rendered in texture and light

**Story Logic:** "Rumah yang bergerak bersamaku" — home is created through shared warmth, not location

---

### Scene 6: Two of Everything

**Location:** Boat deck, interior cabin glimpse
**Time:** Morning, golden light
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Quick montage: Second hammock appears. Second cup set beside first. Clothes draped together. Two plates, two forks. Pendatang hands Pelaut coffee without being asked. Pelaut accepts, touches Pendatang's hand briefly.

**[FILLER] Metaphor Insert:**
- **Compass Stable** — ECU pada kompas: jarumnya stabil, menunjuk satu arah tanpa bergetar. Tujuan hidup sudah ditemukan. No more wandering.

**Key Visuals:**
- Compass needle pointing true (not wavering)
- Solo items becoming paired
- Coffee exchanged naturally
- Small domestic rituals
- Efficiency becoming collaboration

**Emotional Beat:** Love as accumulated gestures—not declarations. Purpose found.

**Story Logic:** Transformation complete—solo setup becomes shared space; compass metaphor = direction found in love

---

# BABAK III — PENGORBANAN (Kelalaian & Pendinginan)

*Visual Goal: Discomfort, isolation, time moving slowly but deadly. Colors cool, textures fray.*

---

### Scene 7: The Question Unasked

**Location:** Boat deck at sunset (overcast)
**Time:** Evening, gray
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pelaut works on sails, focused. Below deck, brief glimpse: water seeping in, just a little. Pendatang notices, touches the water, says nothing. Above, Pelaut calls out—needs help with a rope. Pendatang climbs up, leaving the water unaddressed.

**[FILLER] Environment Inserts:**
- **Sky: Gray** — Langit abu-abu (overcast). Batas antara laut dan langit menjadi kabur, tidak jelas. Horizon disappearing.
- **Decay: Fraying** — Tali layar yang mulai frayed (seratnya putus-putus), menegang karena angin. Seolah akan putus kapan saja.

**Key Visuals:**
- Overcast sky bleeding into gray sea (no horizon line)
- Rope fibers fraying, straining
- Contrast: bright deck above, dark hold below
- Water pooling in hull
- Hand touching water silently
- Rope work continuing unaware

**Emotional Beat:** First signs of trouble—boundaries blurring, structures weakening

**Story Logic:** "Air masuk lambung kapal" — literal water entry begins; environment mirrors decline

---

### Scene 8: Eating Less, Sleeping More

**Location:** Boat deck and interior
**Time:** Multiple days compressed
**Duration:** ~30 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Montage of decline: Pendatang pushes food away. "Tidak lapar." Sleeps during day. Pelaut sees but is focused on navigation—storm clouds gathering. Pendatang's face grows thinner. Clothes hang looser. Eyes lose their searching quality.

**[FILLER] Decay & Isolation Inserts:**
- **Decay: Untouched Food** — Makanan di piring yang tidak disentuh. Ada lalat kecil hinggap. Kehidupan yang tidak dipelihara.
- **Isolation: Foggy Glass** — Kaca jendela kabin berembun, terkena cipratan hujan. Pemandangan luar kabur. Dunia menyempit.
- **Stress: Ashtray** — Asbak rokok yang penuh puntung. Pelaut merokok lebih banyak—sibuk "menjaga kapal," tidak menjaga orang.

**Key Visuals:**
- Untouched plate with small flies
- Foggy, rain-spattered cabin window
- Overflowing ashtray (Pelaut's stress visible)
- Sleeping form during daylight
- Hands thinner than before
- Eyes staring at horizon, but empty now
- Clothes hanging looser

**Emotional Beat:** The slow fade—happening in plain sight, surrounded by signs we chose to ignore

**Story Logic:** "Kau pelan-pelan menghilang" — physical deterioration paralleled by environmental decay

---

### Scene 9: The Question Asked Too Late

**Location:** Boat deck at night
**Time:** Night, stormy
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Rain falls. Pelaut finally stops working, turns to Pendatang. "Apa kau baik-baik saja?" Pendatang smiles—the same smile from the dock, exhausted courage. "Hanya lelah." Pelaut embraces Pendatang tightly, desperately. The rain continues. The hull below takes on more water.

**[FILLER] Pre-Scene Insert:**
- **Fraying Complete** — Tali yang tadi fraying kini putus satu serat. Tidak putus total, tapi sudah mulai. Point of no return approaching.

**Key Visuals:**
- Rope fiber snapping (ECU)
- Rain streaming down faces
- Forced smile, tired eyes
- Desperate embrace
- Water visible through deck gaps

**Emotional Beat:** The moment of realization—too late to save, but we try anyway

**Story Logic:** "Terlambat. Terlalu terlambat." — the embrace is acknowledgment of what cannot be undone

---

# BABAK IV — PENGAKHIRAN (Kekosongan & Sisa)

*Visual Goal: Ghostly traces of someone who was here. Emptiness that still holds shape of presence.*

---

### Scene 10: The Silence of Dawn

**Location:** Boat deck/cabin at dawn
**Time:** Subuh (early dawn), gray light
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pelaut wakes. The space beside them is still. Pendatang's eyes are closed. Their hand is cold. Pelaut's hand reaches out, takes it. Holds it. No movement. No response. Pelaut's face crumbles silently. No scream. Just stillness.

**[FILLER] Ghostly Inserts:**
- **Object: Empty Bed** — Sisi tempat tidur yang kosong dengan seprai masih kusut (bekas tubuh), tapi dingin. The shape of absence.
- **Sound/Visual: Creaking Door** — Pintu kabin terbuka-tutup sendiri tertiup angin. Suara creaking yang sepi. The space responding to loss.

**Key Visuals:**
- Crumpled sheets holding body's impression
- Door creaking open, closed, open
- Gray dawn light, colorless
- Still form, peaceful but wrong
- Hand holding cold hand
- Tears without sound

**Emotional Beat:** Loss beyond words—grief that has no outlet. The space mourns with us.

**Story Logic:** "Kau pergi saat aku tertidur" — death arrived silently, and now the space echoes emptiness

---

### Scene 11: The Ship Stopped

**Location:** Open ocean
**Time:** Morning, overcast
**Duration:** ~25 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pelaut lowers the sails. The boat stops moving. Sits on deck alone, facing where Pendatang used to sit. The horizon stretches empty in all directions. Below deck, water still pooling—but it doesn't matter now. Nothing to save.

**[FILLER] Emptiness Inserts:**
- **Nature: Dead Calm** — Laut yang luas dan datar tanpa ombak (calm). Tapi terasa hampa, bukan damai. No motion, no life.
- **Ghostly Detail** — Pendatang's shirt still hanging where it was left. Moving slightly in wind. Presence without person.

**Key Visuals:**
- Flat, motionless ocean (no waves)
- Sails coming down slowly
- Boat drifting to stillness
- Single figure in vast emptiness
- Beloved's shirt still on the line
- Empty space where someone sat

**Emotional Beat:** Motion stops because the reason for motion is gone. The sea holds its breath.

**Story Logic:** "Kapal yang berhenti di tengah laut" — the journey was never about the destination

---

### Scene 12: The Cup That Waits

**Location:** Boat deck
**Time:** Morning, recurring/eternal
**Duration:** ~20 seconds

**Visual Action:**
Pelaut makes coffee. Pours two cups. Drinks one. The other sits. Grows cold. Pelaut picks it up. Pours it overboard. The boat moves again. The empty cup remains on deck. Ready for tomorrow's ritual.

**[FILLER] Final Symbol:**
- **Steam Dissipating** — ECU pada uap panas yang mengepul dari cangkir kopi. Perlahan uapnya menipis... menipis... hilang. Nyawa/kehadiran yang pergi. The warmth that cannot stay.

**Key Visuals:**
- Steam rising from cup (ECU)
- Steam thinning, disappearing
- Two cups poured
- One drunk, one untouched
- Cold coffee falling into ocean
- Empty cup placed back, waiting
- Boat moving forward, alone

**Emotional Beat:** Grief as daily ritual—the body remembers even when the mind knows. Love persists in gestures for no one.

**Story Logic:** "Cangkir kopi yang tidak pernah diminum" — final image of unprocessed loss; steam = life departing

## Technical Notes for Screenwriter

**Pacing:**
- Acts 1-2 should breathe, flow like calm water
- Act 3 should feel like a slow suffocation
- Act 4 should be almost unbearably still
- **Use filler shots during pauses, not between every line**

**Filler Placement Guidelines:**
- Place atmospheric inserts at act transitions
- Use during moments of silence or internal processing
- Never interrupt dialogue mid-flow
- ECU/abstract shots work best before or after emotional beats

**Transitions:**
- Use match cuts between deck work and intimacy
- Water motif can transition between scenes (ocean → leak → tears → coffee poured)
- Light transitions mark emotional states: golden → warm → gray → cold
- **Filler shots can serve as breathing room between intense scenes**

**Visual Consistency:**
- The boat is the only location—all emotions contained within this space
- Characters never touch land after Scene 3
- Ocean horizon should always be visible—endless, indifferent
- Track texture progression: rough → soft → fraying → ghostly

**Color Temperature:**
- Scenes 1-3: Cool, harsh, brief warm when hands meet
- Scenes 4-6: Warm golden, soft, intimate
- Scenes 7-9: Desaturating, storm colors, gray
- Scenes 10-12: Gray, colorless except for coffee steam

**Dialogue:**
- Minimal. Most lines are already in source. Some scenes need no dialogue at all.
- Indonesian language preserved
- **Filler shots should be completely silent or ambient sound only**
