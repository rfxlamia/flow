---

## WHEN TO USE LONG PROMPTS

### Ideal For:
- Scenes with dialogue
- Multiple characters with continuity
- Structured settings (FG/MG/BG)
- Multi-beat action sequences (>3 beats)
- Recurring characters across shots
- Complex choreography

**Decision Rule:** Use long if scene needs dialogue OR >3 action beats OR character continuity

## PRODUCTION BRIEF FRAMEWORK (11 Blocks)

Include only relevant blocks - skip non-applicable ones.

### Block 1: Format & Tone (MANDATORY)
Genre, tone, rhythm
```
Format & Tone: Cinematic mini-scene - emotional realism with soft
romantic rhythm and atmospheric intimacy.
```

### Block 2: Main Subject(s) (MANDATORY)
Characters, relationship, emotional state
```
Main Subject(s): A young couple standing close under one umbrella
in the rain - their chemistry quiet but electric.
```

### Block 3: Wardrobe and Props (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
Specific clothing, accessories, key props
```
Wardrobe and Props: She wears beige trench coat, pearl earrings;
he wears navy jacket, white shirt, wristwatch.
```

### Block 4: Location & Framing (MANDATORY)
FG/MG/BG structure, spatial anchors
```
Location & Framing: Rain-soaked cobblestone street at dusk.
Foreground: falling raindrops and bokeh reflections.
Midground: the couple framed beneath the umbrella.
Background: café sign glowing amber, blurred city silhouettes.
```

### Block 5: Lighting & Palette (MANDATORY)
Light sources, 3-5 color anchors
```
Lighting & Palette: Warm café light spilling onto cool blue-gray rain.
Color anchors: blush pink, amber gold, navy blue, cool gray.
```

### Block 6: Continuity Rules (CRITICAL FOR MULTI-SHOT)
What MUST remain constant across cuts
```
Continuity Rules: Consistent light rain throughout, dusk lighting,
café window glow always visible, wardrobe unchanged.
```

### Block 7: Actions & Camera Beats (MANDATORY FOR SEQUENCES)
Time-bounded beats with ONE movement each
```
Actions & Camera Beats (0-12s):

0-4s - Wide shot: camera slowly pushes in; she adjusts umbrella.
4-8s - Medium shot: he reaches for her hand; camera drifts laterally.
8-12s - Close-up: foreheads gently meet; camera rises slightly.
```

### Block 8: Montage Plan (OPTIONAL)
Cut types, pacing, transitions
```
Montage Plan: Three inserts: (raindrop → fingertip touch → smile).
Smooth match cuts guided by piano rhythm.
```

### Block 9: Dialogue (IF APPLICABLE)
Format: `Character: "Text"`
```
Dialogue:
She whispers: "Stay a little longer."
He exhales softly, smiling. (no subtitles)
```

### Block 10: Sound & Foley (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
Micro-sounds, ambient, music, silence
```
Sound & Foley: Soft rainfall, muffled footsteps on wet cobblestone,
umbrella fabric tension, soft piano underscore with subtle reverb.
```

### Block 11: Finish (OPTIONAL)
Film grain, halation, LUT intent, poster frame
```
Finish: Light film grain, warm halation on highlights,
LUT intent: vintage romance with teal-amber contrast.
```

## PROGRESSIVE DETAIL STRATEGY

**Minimum Viable (4 blocks):**
1, 2, 4, 7 (Format, Subject, Location, Actions)

**Standard (7 blocks):**
Add: 3, 5, 10 (Wardrobe, Lighting, Sound)

**Maximum (all 11):**
For flagship content, multi-shot continuity, client work

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

**Vague Timing:** "At some point he smiles"
**Precise:** "4-8s: he smiles as she touches his hand"

**Multiple Movements:** "0-4s: Dolly in while arc left"
**One Movement:** "0-4s: Dolly in" OR "0-4s: Arc left"

**Missing FG/MG/BG:** "They stand on street"
**Spatial Anchors:** "FG: raindrops, MG: couple, BG: café glow"

**Generic Colors:** "Nice lighting"
**Color Anchors:** "Amber gold, navy blue, blush pink"
