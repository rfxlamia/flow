2. Fill in relevant blocks (skip non-applicable ones)
3. Follow guidance notes in [brackets]
4. Remove brackets and guidance before final prompt
5. Validate with checklist at end

---

## Block 1: Format & Tone

[MANDATORY - Define genre and emotional direction]

**Format & Tone:** [Cinematic ad / UGC reaction / Music video / Mini-scene / Documentary] - [emotional descriptor, rhythm, atmosphere]

**Tone:** [2-3 emotion/mood words]

**Example:** Cinematic mini-scene - emotional realism with soft romantic rhythm and atmospheric intimacy. Tone: nostalgic, tender, immersive.

---

## Block 2: Main Subject(s)

[MANDATORY - Define characters]

**Main Subject(s):** [Number of people, brief physical description, relationship dynamic, emotional state]

[If single character: detailed description]  
[If multiple: describe each and their relationship]

**Example:** A young couple standing close under one umbrella in the rain - their chemistry quiet but electric, eyes locked, hesitant smiles.

---

## Block 3: Wardrobe & Props

[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Ensures visual continuity]

**Wardrobe and Props:** [Character 1 outfit with colors], [Character 2 outfit]. Props: [key objects with descriptions].

[Be specific: "beige trench coat" not "coat"]  
[Include reflective items: watches, jewelry]  
[List all props that play narrative role]

**Example:** She wears beige trench coat, pearl earrings, carries transparent umbrella; he wears navy jacket, white shirt, wristwatch reflecting streetlight. Props: umbrella, takeaway coffee cup gently steaming.

---

## Block 4: Location & Framing

[MANDATORY - Establish spatial relationships]

**Location description:** [Specific place with sensory details]

**Foreground:** [Elements closest to camera]  
**Midground:** [Main action area, where characters are]  
**Background:** [Depth elements, context]

**Camera guidance:** [Shot sizes, angles, movement preferences across beats]

**Example:**  
Rain-soaked cobblestone street at dusk outside softly glowing café.  
Foreground: falling raindrops and bokeh reflections.  
Midground: the couple framed beneath the umbrella.  
Background: café sign glowing amber, blurred city silhouettes.  
Camera alternates between gentle dolly-ins, over-shoulder close-ups, and slow ¾ circular arcs.

---

## Block 5: Lighting & Palette

[MANDATORY - Define visual mood]

**Lighting:** [Overall lighting quality]

**Light sources:** [Specific sources: practical, natural, artificial]

**Color anchors:** [3-5 specific colors that define the scene]

**Atmospheric effects:** [Haze, diffusion, bloom, etc.]

[Color anchors are CRITICAL for continuity - repeat these exact colors in related shots]

**Example:**  
Warm café light spilling onto cool blue-gray rain.  
Light sources: diffused streetlight key from camera left, amber window backlight.  
Color anchors: blush pink, amber gold, navy blue, cool gray, ivory skin tones.  
Soft diffusion lens and wet reflections maintain continuity.

---

## Block 6: Continuity Rules

[CRITICAL FOR MULTI-SHOT - Lock constant elements]

**Continuity Rules:** [Weather], [time of day], [lighting conditions], [wardrobe reference], [location atmosphere elements]

[What MUST NOT change between shots?]

**Example:** Consistent light rain throughout, dusk lighting (blue hour), café window glow always visible in background, wardrobe unchanged.

---

## Block 7: Actions & Camera Beats

[MANDATORY FOR SEQUENCES - Choreograph precise timing]

**Actions & Camera Beats ([START_TIME]–[END_TIME]s):**

[TIME_RANGE]s - [SHOT SIZE]: [ONE camera movement from vocabulary]; [subject action]

0-[X]s - [Wide/Medium/Close-up]: [ONE camera movement]; [subject does what]

[X]-[Y]s - [Shot size]: [ONE camera movement]; [subject does what]

[Y]-[Z]s - [Shot size]: [ONE camera movement]; [subject does what]

[Remember: One beat = ONE camera movement only]  
[Use exact terms from camera-movements vocabulary]  
[Pair each camera move with one subject action]

**Example:**  
0-4s - Wide shot: camera slowly pushes in through rain toward couple; she adjusts umbrella, faint smile.  
4-8s - Medium shot: he reaches for her hand; droplets cascade down joined fingers; camera drifts laterally, catching reflection of neon light across faces.  
8-12s - Close-up: their foreheads gently meet; camera rises slightly, focusing on breath mixing in rain-haze before fading into soft blur.

---

## Block 8: Montage Plan

[OPTIONAL - For complex editing]

**Montage Plan:**

[Number] inserts: ([insert 1] → [insert 2] → [insert 3])

**Cut types:** [match cut, jump cut, etc.]

**Transitions:** [whip-pan, flash-frame, etc.]

**Pacing:** [fast/slow, holds, timing]

[Skip if simple single-take scene]

**Example:** Three inserts: (raindrop hitting umbrella → fingertip touch → smile). Smooth match cuts guided by piano rhythm; final 0.5-second emotional hold before fade-out. Transitions use natural lens flares from passing car headlights.

---

## Block 9: Dialogue

[IF APPLICABLE - Format with colon]

**Dialogue:**

[Character name]: "[Dialogue text]"  
[Another character]: "[Response]"

[Add (no subtitles) if you want clean frame]

[Skip entire block if no dialogue]

**Example:**  
Whisper (female): "Stay a little longer."  
He exhales softly, smiling. (no subtitles)

---

## Block 10: Sound & Foley

[HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Layer soundscape]

**Sound & Foley:**

[List micro-sounds]: [specific small sounds]  
[Ambient audio]: [environmental base layer]  
[Music]: [if applicable, describe style and timing]

[Be specific: "umbrella fabric tension" vs "umbrella sound"]  
[Layer multiple sound elements]  
[Note if silence is intentional]

**Example:** Soft rainfall, muffled footsteps on wet cobblestone, umbrella fabric tension, faint breath, distant café hum, soft piano underscore with subtle reverb.

---

## Block 11: Finish

[OPTIONAL - Style polish]

**Finish:**

[Film grain]: [intensity if desired]  
[Halation]: [glow around highlights]  
[LUT intent]: [color grading direction]  
[Special effects]: [chromatic aberration, bloom, etc.]

**Poster frame:** [Describe final memorable image]

[Skip if no special post-processing needed]

**Example:**  
Light film grain, warm halation on highlights, gentle chromatic bloom around neon reflections.  
LUT intent: vintage romance with balanced teal-amber contrast.  
Poster frame: their hands clasped beneath umbrella, neon reflections rippling across puddled ground like living light.

## Quick Tips

### For Minimum Viable Prompt (4 blocks):
1. Format & Tone
2. Main Subjects  
4. Location & Framing
7. Actions & Camera Beats

### For Standard Prompt (7 blocks):
Add: 3. Wardrobe & Props, 5. Lighting & Palette, 10. Sound & Foley

### For Maximum Quality (all 11 blocks):
Use everything for flagship content

### Progressive Build Strategy:
1. Start with 4 mandatory blocks
2. Add wardrobe/props if continuity needed
3. Add lighting/palette for mood control
4. Add sound/foley for immersion
5. Add montage/finish for polish

---

## Common Filling Mistakes

### ❌ Too Vague:
"A person in a place doing something"

### ✅ Specific:
"Young woman in red coat walks through autumn park, kicking leaves"

---

### ❌ Missing Spatial Structure:
Location: "Street"

### ✅ FG/MG/BG:
Foreground: fallen leaves  
Midground: woman walking  
Background: trees and benches

---

### ❌ Generic Colors:
"Nice colors"

### ✅ Color Anchors:
"Burnt orange, deep red, golden yellow, cool gray"

---

### ❌ Multiple Movements:
"0-4s: Dolly in while panning"

### ✅ One Movement:
"0-4s: Dolly in" (choose one!)

---

## Integration Notes

- Use **camera-movements skill** for vocabulary in Block 7
- Validate with **great-prompt-anatomy** for 8 core components
- If scene becomes simpler than expected, consider **short-prompt-guide**
- Color anchors from Block 5 should repeat in Block 6 (Continuity Rules)

---

## Final Assembly

After filling template:
1. Remove all [brackets] and guidance text
2. Remove block numbers/labels (just content)
3. Verify checklist
4. Submit to Veo 3

Your final prompt should be pure production brief content without any meta-instructions.
