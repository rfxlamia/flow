# Short Prompt Guide Reference

Efficient prompting for filler shots and atmospheric scenes.

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Format + Style Upfront

**Golden Rule:** Always declare format and style FIRST, then describe scene.

**Template:**
```
Format & style: [genre/aesthetic]
[Scene description in 1-3 sentences]
```

**Example:**
```
Format & style: Cinematic B-roll, warm color grade
Coffee cup steaming on wooden table at dawn café.
Slow dolly in, close-up. Warm morning light, soft diffusion.
Gentle café ambience. (no subtitles)
```

## WHEN TO USE SHORT PROMPTS

### Ideal For:
- Filler/atmosphere shots
- Transition moments
- Quick establishing shots
- B-roll footage
- Simple product shots
- Single-subject scenes

### NOT For:
- Scenes with dialogue
- Multiple characters with continuity
- Complex action sequences
- Multi-beat choreography

**Decision Rule:** Use short if scene needs <3 sentences to describe

## TWO APPROACHES

### Approach 1: Descriptive (Painting a Picture)
Describe scene, character, or situation. AI interprets creatively.

**Structure:**
```
Format & style: [aesthetic]
Subject/Action: [1-2 compact sentences]
Setting & time: [when/where]
Camera/Composition: [shot + angle + 1 movement]
Lighting/Mood: [brief]
Audio: [ambience/short dialogue]
```

**Example:**
```
Format & style: Cinematic filler, anime watercolor aesthetic
Subject/Action: A rapper writes lyrics in small bedroom studio.
Posters on walls, microphone on desk, headphones around neck.
Setting: Night, warm desk lamp glow
Camera: Medium shot, slow push in
Lighting: Warm practical lights, cool window moonlight
Audio: Soft lo-fi beats, pen scratching paper
```

### Approach 2: Directive (Giving a Command)
Direct command with specific actions, cuts, or sequence.

**Structure:**
```
Format & style: [aesthetic]
Make a [type] video: [subject] [action sequence]
[Specific cuts/beats]: [timing]
[Audio]: [sounds/dialogue]
```

**Example:**
```
Format & style: UGC reaction video, iPhone 14 Pro Max, vertical 9:16
Make a taste-test reaction: person tries new energy drink
Three fast cuts - open can (crack sound), sip, smile and nod
Audio: Can opening, sip sound, "Wow, that's good!" (no subtitles)
```

## ULTRA-MINIMAL TEMPLATE

```
[Format+Style]. [Subject] [Action] in [Setting]. [Camera]. [Lighting]. [Audio]. [Constraints]
```

**Example:**
```
Cinematic B-roll. Coffee cup steaming on wooden table at dawn café.
Slow dolly in, close-up. Warm morning light, soft diffusion.
Gentle café ambience. (no subtitles)
```

## COMMON MISTAKES

**Too Vague:** "A person doing something interesting"
**Specific:** "A chef flambéing dessert, blue flame leaping up"

**Format Buried:** "Person walks down street. It's a noir style."
**Format First:** "Neo-noir style. Person walks down rain-slicked street."

**Multiple Movements:** "Dolly in while panning left and tilting up"
**One Movement:** "Arc left around subject"
