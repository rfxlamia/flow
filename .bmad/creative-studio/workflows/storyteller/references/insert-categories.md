# Insert Categories Reference

Atmospheric insert categories for texture-based storytelling.

---

## CORE CATEGORIES

### 1. DECAY
**Emotional Function:** Loss, passage of time, neglect, isolation

**Visual Focus:**
- Peeling paint, rust, weathering
- Salt crystallization, corrosion
- Faded colors, sun bleaching
- Cracked surfaces, deterioration

**Example Shots:**
- ECU: Peeling boat paint with salt in cracks
- Detail: Rust spreading across metal chain
- CU: Faded photograph curling at edges

**Story Position:** Often opening shots, establishing brokenness

---

### 2. INTIMACY
**Emotional Function:** Connection, warmth, tenderness, growing love

**Visual Focus:**
- Hands (touching, holding, working together)
- Shared objects (two cups, paired items)
- Proximity (shoulders touching, breath visible)
- Warmth (steam, golden light, soft textures)

**Example Shots:**
- ECU: Two hands meeting over rope work
- Detail: Two tin cups side by side, steam rising
- CU: Cigarette smoke merging from two sources

**Story Position:** Relationship development, peak connection

---

### 3. STRAIN
**Emotional Function:** Tension, breaking point, stress, deterioration

**Visual Focus:**
- Fraying (rope, fabric, edges)
- Overflowing (ashtray, water, containers)
- Stretching (material under tension)
- Neglect (untouched food, unmade bed)

**Example Shots:**
- ECU: Hemp rope with visible fiber separation
- Detail: Ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts
- CU: Untouched food growing cold

**Story Position:** Relationship challenges, building tension

---

### 4. ABSENCE
**Emotional Function:** Grief, emptiness, ghost presence, loss

**Visual Focus:**
- Empty spaces (bed impression, vacant chair)
- Single objects (one cup instead of two)
- Ghost movement (door moving alone, curtain)
- Void (dead calm water, colorless sky)

**Example Shots:**
- Detail: Bed with impression of absent body
- CU: Single shirt hanging where two were
- Wide: Dead calm sea, no movement

**Story Position:** Loss, aftermath, resolution

## TEXTURE PROGRESSION MAP

| Story Phase | Primary Category | Texture Quality | Color Temp |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Opening | Decay | Rough, harsh | Cool blues |
| Development | Intimacy | Soft, warm | Golden |
| Conflict | Strain | Fraying, tense | Desaturating |
| Resolution | Absence | Empty, still | Colorless |

## PLACEMENT STRATEGY

### Pre-Scene Placement
**Purpose:** Set emotional atmosphere before action
**When:** Before introducing characters or major scenes
**Duration:** 2-3 seconds
**Example:** Decay insert before protagonist first appears

### Mid-Scene Placement
**Purpose:** Emotional punctuation, breathing room
**When:** During complex scenes, after emotional beats
**Duration:** 2-4 seconds
**Example:** Strain insert during argument scene

### Post-Scene Placement
**Purpose:** Lingering resonance, transition
**When:** After major events, before scene change
**Duration:** 3-4 seconds
**Example:** Absence insert after departure

## SENSORY MAPPING

Track these across all inserts for consistency:

**Water Motif:**
```
Aggressive (waves attacking) → Calm (gentle lapping) →
Leak (dripping) → Dead calm (mirror surface)
```

**Light Progression:**
```
Harsh dawn → Golden hour →
Overcast → Dim/colorless
```

**Sound Implication:**
```
Violent (storm) → Gentle (waves) →
Creaking (strain) → Silence (void)
```
