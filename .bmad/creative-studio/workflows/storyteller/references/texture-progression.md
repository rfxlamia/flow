# Texture Progression Reference

Framework for maintaining visual texture consistency across story arc.

## TEXTURE EVOLUTION FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: ROUGH/DECAYED (Opening)
**Represents:** Broken world, isolation, pre-connection state

**Texture Palette:**
- Weathered wood, salt-crusted surfaces
- Cracked paint, peeling materials
- Harsh metal, rust, corrosion
- Sun-bleached, faded fabrics

**Color Approach:**
- Cool blues, grays
- Desaturated earth tones
- High contrast, harsh shadows

**Material Focus:**
- Hard surfaces dominate
- Organic decay visible
- Neglect apparent

---

### Phase 2: SOFT/WARM (Development)
**Represents:** Growing intimacy, connection, hope

**Texture Palette:**
- Worn but loved fabric
- Smooth skin, weathered hands
- Steam, smoke, breath (ephemeral)
- Polished wood, oiled leather

**Color Approach:**
- Golden hour warmth
- Amber, orange accents
- Soft shadows, low contrast

**Material Focus:**
- Soft materials appear
- Human touch visible (wear patterns)
- Care shown in objects

---

### Phase 3: FRAYING/NEGLECTED (Conflict)
**Represents:** Strain, deterioration, breaking point

**Texture Palette:**
- Separating fibers
- Accumulating mess (overflowing)
- Stretched materials
- Drying, cracking surfaces

**Color Approach:**
- Desaturating palette
- Warmth fading
- Shadows deepening

**Material Focus:**
- Materials under stress
- Neglect returning
- Entropy accelerating

---

### Phase 4: GHOSTLY/EMPTY (Resolution)
**Represents:** Absence, grief, aftermath

**Texture Palette:**
- Smooth, still surfaces
- Untouched materials
- Dust accumulation
- Mirror-like water

**Color Approach:**
- Near-colorless
- Muted, flat
- Diffused light, no shadows

**Material Focus:**
- Absence of human touch
- Stillness prominent
- Single objects (not pairs)

---

## SYMBOLIC OBJECT TRACKING

### Recurring Props Progression

**Rope (Example):**
```
Phase 1: Tangled, chaotic
Phase 2: Hands working together on it
Phase 3: Fraying, fibers separating
Phase 4: Snapped, two ends separate
```

**Shared Objects (Example: Cups):**
```
Phase 1: Single cup, alone
Phase 2: Two cups, steam merging
Phase 3: One cup untouched, cold
Phase 4: Single cup remaining
```

## VISUAL THEME TRACKING

### Water Motif
| Phase | Water State | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Aggressive waves | Hostile world |
| 2 | Gentle lapping | Calm connection |
| 3 | Leaking/dripping | Control slipping |
| 4 | Dead calm | Void, stillness |

### Light Motif
| Phase | Light Quality | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Harsh dawn | Cold reality |
| 2 | Golden hour | Peak warmth |
| 3 | Overcast | Hope dimming |
| 4 | Flat/diffused | Emptiness |

### Sound Implication
| Phase | Implied Sound | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Storm, harsh | Violence |
| 2 | Quiet waves | Peace |
| 3 | Creaking, strain | Tension |
| 4 | Silence | Void |

## APPLICATION GUIDELINES

### When Generating Inserts:
1. Check current story phase
2. Select textures from appropriate palette
3. Ensure color approach matches
4. Track symbolic objects
5. Maintain progression consistency

### Transition Inserts:
Between phases, use transitional textures:
- Phase 1→2: First soft element appears
- Phase 2→3: First fraying visible
- Phase 3→4: First empty space

## INTEGRATION WITH CATEGORIES

| Category | Best Phase Fit | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Decay | Phase 1, 3 | Opening and decline |
| Intimacy | Phase 2 | Peak connection |
| Strain | Phase 3 | Conflict period |
| Absence | Phase 4 | Resolution/loss |
