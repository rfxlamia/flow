# Step 2: Create Directory Structure

**Purpose:** Build organized project workspace with all necessary folders and files

---

## Instructions

Using the information gathered from Step 1, create the project directory structure.

### Directory Path Format

```
{output_folder}/projects/{project_name}-{timestamp}/
```

Where:
- `{output_folder}` = from BMAD config (typically `docs/`)
- `{project_name}` = slug from Step 1
- `{timestamp}` = ISO format like `2025-12-14T12-30-00Z`

**Example:** `docs/projects/dua-pelaut-satu-lautan-2025-12-14T12-30-00Z/`

---

## Directory Structure to Create

```
{project_folder}/
├── project-config.yaml          # Project configuration (from template)
├── pipeline-state.yaml          # Per-project pipeline state tracking
├── README.md                    # Project documentation (from template)
│
├── 01-diverse/                  # Stage 1: Diverse content generation
├── 02-storyteller/              # Stage 2: Visual scene breakdown (video)
├── 03-screenwriter/             # Stage 3: Screenplay formatting (video)
├── 04-validator/                # Stage 4: Production validation (video)
├── 05-imagine/                  # Stage 5: Imagen prompt generation (video)
└── 06-arch-v/                   # Stage 6: Veo 3 video prompts (video)
```

**Note:** For non-video content types, stages 02-06 may have different names in future versions.

## Create Configuration File

Copy template from `templates/project-config.yaml.template` and populate with variables:

```yaml
# Creative Studio Project Configuration
# Generated: {timestamp}

project:
  name: "{project_name}"
  display_name: "{display_name}"  # Original user input
  created: "{timestamp}"
  author: "{user_name}"  # From BMAD config

content:
  type: "{content_type}"           # video, blog, carousel, etc
  platform: "{target_platform}"    # youtube, instagram, etc
  estimated_length: "{estimated_length}"
  description: |
    {description}

pipeline:
  type: "video-full"  # video-full, blog-post, carousel, etc
  current_stage: 0
  stages_completed: []

status: "initialized"  # initialized, in-progress, completed

paths:
  project_root: "docs/projects/{project_name}-{timestamp}"
  outputs: "outputs/"

# Stage tracking
stages:
  "01-diverse":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
  "02-storyteller":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
  "03-screenwriter":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
  "04-validator":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
  "05-imagine":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
  "06-arch-v":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
```

Save to: `{project_folder}/project-config.yaml`

---

## Create Pipeline State File

Create a per-project pipeline state tracker:

```yaml
# Creative Studio Pipeline State
# Project: {project_name}-{timestamp}
# Auto-updated by workflows as they complete

project_id: "{project_name}-{timestamp}"
current_stage: 0
last_updated: "{timestamp}"

# Stage Tracking
stages:
  "01-diverse":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "01-diverse/"

  "02-storyteller":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "02-storyteller/"
    input_from: "01-diverse"

  "03-screenwriter":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "03-screenwriter/"
    input_from: "02-storyteller"

  "04-validator":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "04-validator/"
    input_from: "03-screenwriter"

  "05-imagine":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "05-imagine/"
    input_from: "04-validator"

  "06-arch-v":
    status: "pending"
    outputs: []
    output_location: "06-arch-v/"
    input_from: "05-imagine"

# Quick Access
next_stage_ready: false
next_stage: "01-diverse"
last_output: null
```

Save to: `{project_folder}/pipeline-state.yaml`

---

## Create README File

Copy template from `templates/README.md.template` and populate:

```markdown
# {display_name}

**Project ID:** {project_name}-{timestamp}
**Created:** {timestamp}
**Type:** {content_type}
**Platform:** {target_platform}

## Description

{description}

## Project Details

- **Estimated Length:** {estimated_length}
- **Pipeline:** {pipeline_type}
- **Status:** {status}

## Directory Structure

- `01-diverse/` - Creative variations from diverse-content-gen
- `02-storyteller/` - Visual scene breakdown
- `03-screenwriter/` - Professional screenplay
- `04-validator/` - Production validation
- `05-imagine/` - Imagen prompts for images
- `06-arch-v/` - Veo 3 prompts for video

## Workflow Progress

- [ ] Stage 01: Diverse Content Generation
- [ ] Stage 02: Storyteller
- [ ] Stage 03: Screenwriter
- [ ] Stage 04: Production Validator
- [ ] Stage 05: Imagine
- [ ] Stage 06: Arch-V

## Notes

Add your project notes here as you work through the pipeline.

---

*Generated by Creative Studio v1.1.0*
```

Save to: `{project_folder}/README.md`

---

## Confirmation

After creating all directories and files, confirm:

✅ Project folder created
✅ All stage directories created
✅ project-config.yaml generated
✅ README.md generated
✅ Output directory ready

**Output the full project path for user confirmation.**

## Next Step

Proceed to `step-03-register-project.md` to register this project in the global registry.
