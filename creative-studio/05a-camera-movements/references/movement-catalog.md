## Validation Notes

### Conflict Combinations to Avoid

**Directional Conflicts:**
- ❌ Dolly In + Arc Left (opposing directions)
- ❌ Crane Up + Tilt Down (counteracting)
- ❌ Zoom In + Dolly Out (unless intentional Vertigo effect)

**Multiple Movement Conflicts:**
- ❌ Dolly In + Pan Left + Tilt Up (too many movements)
- ❌ Arc Left + Crane Up + Focus Change (overwhelming)

### Compatible Combinations

**Common Pairings:**
- ✅ Dolly In + Focus Change
- ✅ Arc Left + Tilt Up (compound smooth movement)
- ✅ Crane Up + Pan Right (sweeping reveal)
- ✅ Static + Focus Change (simple emphasis)

**Rule:** One beat = ONE primary movement (focus change is exception as it's subtle)

## Usage in ARCH-V Prompts

**For Actions & Camera Beats block:**
```
0-4s - Wide shot: Dolly In; subject walks toward camera
4-8s - Medium shot: Arc Right; subject turns, scanning room
8-12s - Close-up: Static with Focus Change; eyes to hands
```

**For Montage Plan:**
```
Three inserts with Whip Pan transitions between each
```

**For validation:**
- Check each beat has ONE movement
- Verify movement name matches this catalog exactly
- Ensure no conflicting movements in sequence
